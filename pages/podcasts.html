                <p>What counts as art? Does it have to be a world-renowned painting? Or can it be the sumo-wrestling you
                    see on the Japanese TV channel? How about the sandwich that sits on your plate? Do You See What I
                    See is an arts &amp; culture podcast about looking at the world through a new lens. In this podcast,
                    we ask ourselves what things in our lives sit disguised as mundane or crude, and what would happen
                    if we viewed those things as art.</p>

                        Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network (as well as any kids movie from our youth). We will explore
                        that result with a recap of the product, and explore our modern opinions (as well as the social
                        media discussion on it since).</span></p>

                        emotionally gripping, boundary-pushing films in modern cinema, like Welcome to Marwen and The
