Panda Bear—the stage name of Noah Lennox, best known for his work as a member of critically acclaimed Baltimore band Animal Collective—will be performing at the Paradise Rock Club on Friday, May 4. Panda Bear is touring in support of January’s vinyl-only EP _A Day With the Homies_ as well as a new album _BOUY_, the details of which have not been officially announced.

His upcoming concert is part of a US tour that follows a string of European dates last month, during which he played, among some older tracks, a total of nine new songs which are presumed to make up _BOUY_. The new material marks a departure from his previous sound, featuring prominent acoustic guitars as in earlier Animal Collective and solo releases, but warped and sampled to create a more electronically experimental sound.  

Opening the show will be fellow Animal Collective member Geologist, who has only recently begun to explore a solo career and has not yet officially released any music under his own name. However, at the show he will be selling a limited-edition cassette, the _Live in the Land of the Sky_ EP, which was recorded last fall.

Panda Bear’s upcoming Boston show will be at 8 p.m., and tickets are available [here](https://www.ticketmaster.com/panda-bear-paradise-rock-club-boston-ma/venueartist/8227/1410687) or at the box office.
