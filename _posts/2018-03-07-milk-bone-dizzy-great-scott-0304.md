Electro-pop Canadian duo Milk & Bone released their sophomore effort, _Deception Bay_, in early February. They began jet setting across Canada and the United States in March to tour the album. Band members Laurence Lafond-Beaulne and Camille Poliquin returned to Great Scott in Allston on March 4 for a night wrapped up in floaty vocals, harrowing lyrics, and deep electronic synths.

Canada-based indie rock band Dizzy opened the show. The band is comprised of Katie Munshaw (vocalist), Charlie Spencer (drummer, synths), Alex Spencer (guitarist) and Mack Spencer (bassist). With only two released songs to date, and a few still being workshopped, the band is still figuring out their rather stiff stage presence. A few songs in, it was clear that their strength ultimately lies in their ability to tell coming-of-age stories with a solid beat. That being said, their most popular song, “Stars and Moons,” reminiscent of the band PVRIS, proves them a group worth keeping an eye on.

More audience members poured into the venue as Milk & Bone took the stage a short while later. The duo, both wearing huge black platform boots, black nylon sweatsuits, and black eye makeup, made it clear early on that they work in tandem. They met as music students at a university in Quebec, and agreed to begin writing and performing in 2013. Though they speak French, they write and record in English.

Their chemistry radiated from the stage as soon as they positioned themselves behind the mirrored soundboard, drum sticks in hand. Opening with a track off of their first EP, the thudding, languid bass of “Coconut Water” allowed both the band and the audience members to fall into a trance of their dreamy sound.

As seen with “KIDS,” the two began to leave their place behind the soundboard and came to the front of the stage. Smiling wide, they were dancing and singing to each other. The haunting lyrics _“Funny how things can just change so fast / strange to think that I thought I would be the one to make it last,”_ juxtaposed the seemingly innocent fun the two were having.

Lafond-Beaulne and Poliquin have found the perfect balance of attention to their own craft on the soundboard and the audience. They focused more on their manipulation of vocals and layering of synths during electronic-heavy songs, as seen with “Faded.” This allowed the audience to have quieter moments of focus. The two also had audience members sing along during more popular, upbeat songs–such as Spotify favorite “Daydream”–with smiles as they pointed the microphone to the energetic crowd.

Milk & Bone closed their set with “BBBlue” (not counting their added encore). It was the perfect song about nostalgia for a past love, and clearly one of their own favorites. The live rendition allowed the song to come to life, with the two sharing glances, they transported themselves into their own world.

_Deception Bay_ confirms nothing but growth from the 2015 EP, _Little Mourning._ This is an album worth an entire listen-through. Though their voices are light and airy, Lafond-Beaulne and Poliquin develop harsh undertones and lyrics that force listeners to reflect on heartbreak. An album that tells stories personal enough to get an intimate look into their mind and experiences, yet broad enough for listeners to apply themes to their own life, _Deception Bay_ shows that Milk & Bone have found their creative footing.
