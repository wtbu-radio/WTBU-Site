The first song on Beirut’s impressive 24 song setlist was “When I Die” off their new album, _Gallipoli_, released just two weeks prior to the show. Zach Condon, Beirut’s frontman, claimed through his lyrics, “I promise that I’ll get it right/I’ve been practicing my whole life,” which isn’t far from the truth for the musician who’s been playing trumpet since he was a high school student in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Between dropping out of high school at 17 to travel the world and explore music to standing on stage at the House of Blues 16 years later, touring for his 5th studio album, it’s easy to see that Condon has indeed been practicing his whole life. Whether he gets it right or not depends on whether you believe Balkan folk, Mariachi Mexican, and electronic pop music are fit to blend.

Whether or not you believe the phases in Condon’s career that make up those mix of genres should mingle, the setlist did just that. Each song fused and flowed into the next, from “Fener” to “Postcards from Italy” to “After the Curtain,” until we were left with one long, homespun, nostalgic pop song. The band performed under barebone stage decor, consisting of a wrinkled off-white sheet used as a backdrop to the numerous mic stands on stage. Pulsing colored lights shifted the tone and mood throughout the night, which started off with energetic flashing bright reds and oranges, later transitioning into darker blues and greens of the ocean. This set the mood for their performance of “The Rip Tide,” which broke up the pop melody with recognition from an audience, who ironically perked back up to the soft and melancholy lyrics, “I feel alone/Feel alone, now.”

As always, Condon switched from instrument to instrument, between and during songs, starting with his six string ukulele to the trumpet to the synthesizer.  Condon shared a short anecdote on stage about his band members barring him from bringing an old large drum machine on tour.  He sheepishly laughed while noting, “I’m attracted to breakable toys!” I had the pleasure of standing right in front of the trombone player, Ben Lanz, who synchronized every note with the band’s trumpet player Kyle Resnick. On keyboard was Aaron Arntz, who doubled as the band’s accordion player. The only members sticking to one instrument were drummer Nick Petree and bassist Paul Collins, who quietly held down and maintained the set throughout the night.

The show confirmed that Condon indeed got it right, not shying away from his own sound and confidence as he may have done in earlier versions of himself.  At the end of the show, he came out on stage, on his own, for the encore, “Un Dernier Verre (Pour la Route),” a throwback from Beirut’s second studio album, _The Flying Club Cap._ With only his ukulele and voice on stage, Condon sounded exactly like someone who had been practicing for this moment his whole life.
