**What is your favorite meme at the moment?**

My favorite meme at the moment is the girl whose shadow looks like Rihanna.

**Why did you decide to join WTBU?**

I decided originally to join because a lot of my friends were involved and on shows. I had grown up around a lot of music and I wanted to keep up with my interests and hobbies surrounding music. I began doing it with my good friend Mariel. I interned sophomore year and got a show junior year.

**What do you like to do outside of WTBU?**

I love watching movies and being with friends. I also LOVE Ru Paul’s Drag Race. Other activities I enjoy doing is exploring and looking at queer art.

Honestly, the stats exam that I have tomorrow.
