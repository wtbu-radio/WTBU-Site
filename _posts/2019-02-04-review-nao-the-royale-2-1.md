British R&B songbird Nao captivated a young and eager audience at a sold-out show at Boston’s Royale on Friday night. Following the release of her latest album, _Saturn_, which came out in October, 2018, Nao is embarking on her first world tour.

Dressed in a fashion forward green jumpsuit and a white shawl, Nao opened the show by handing out white balloons to audience members as a symbolic gesture — her album cover for _Saturn_ depicts her standing in a desert with a bouquet of them. It was clear by the crowd’s excitement that Nao’s presence in the US, particularly Boston, was highly anticipated; the singer herself seemed to be thrilled by the greeting.

Nao’s unique singing voice proved to be just as entrancing from a stage as it is from the studio. She opened the show with her first single from _Saturn_, “Another Lifetime”, followed by the next two singles from that album, “If You Ever” and “Make It Out Alive”. Nao carried the tunes with ease, showcasing her ethereal, high-pitched vocals.

The R&B singer also managed to sprinkle some tunes from her debut album of 2016, _For All We Know_, into the setlist. Among them were singles “Fool to Love” and “Girlfriend”. Nao ended the show with “Drive and Disconnect” from _Saturn_, and “Bad Blood”, a 2015 single from _For All We Know_.

Judging by Friday night’s performance, Nao has met a welcoming fan base in the States. She delivered an energetic, bubbly, and impressive concert experience that had her fans singing and dancing with her to every song. After a few more stops in the US, Nao will be performing in Europe through the end of March.
