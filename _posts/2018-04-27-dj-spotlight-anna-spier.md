Anna Spier, Transmission Impossible (Tuesdays 12-2 am)

COM Film/TV 2020

**What music are you listening to right now?**

Get Stupid by Aston Merrygold, it’s a bop. Also, the 50 Shades soundtrack, but I don’t want to say that.

**What’s your favorite part of WTBU?**

Interacting with my fellow DJs is really fun. I really like just discussing music, and on our show we talk about a lot of films so that’s really fun too.

**Do you do any other extracurricular?**

I write for Her Campus, I work on BUTV10 and I also do Squinch Magazine. I’m making a comic for the next issue. I don’t know what it’s going to be yet, probably something from my childhood.

**What’s your favorite movie?**

Definitely When Harry Met Sally, it’s the best.

**Is there a movie that you’ve ever seen that you really didn’t like?**

Perfume with Alan Rickman is terrible but it’s the funniest bad movie there ever was.

**What was the last show you binge-watched?**

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel

**What’s your favorite sea creature?**

Cuttlefish, they’re a snazzy one.

**What’s your ideal radio time slot?**

Ooh, 8-10 pm, probably on a Tuesday. It would be nice. I don’t have many classes on Wednesdays so it’d be nice.

**On a scale of 1-10, how do you feel about BU housing right now?**

Hmm, probably a 5.

**What’s a class that you’re really excited to take next year?**

One of the screenwriting ones I’m planning on taking sounds really fun

**If you could be a non-COM major what would it be?**

I’m not sure, maybe astronomy, but I don’t think I really have the brain for that. The math side of it would probably be really hard, but I think it’s really interesting.
