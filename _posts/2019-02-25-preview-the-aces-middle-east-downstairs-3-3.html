<p><em>By Angel Kim</em></p>
<p>The wait for the <em>Waiting For You</em> tour will finally be over when The Aces perform downstairs at the Middle East this Sunday, 3/3. From Provo, UT, The Aces are an indie pop rock band consisting of Cristal Ramirez, Alisa Ramirez, McKenna Petty and Katie Henderson who released their debut album, <em>When My Heart Felt Volcanic</em>, through Red Bull Records last year. Their bright and vivid sound, also characteristic of recent Paramore and The 1975, is infused with 80’s influences- shown in tracks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOlVELlP2jk">“Volcanic Love”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHt-Y4r1RFs">“Last One”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsy6TE8lrLQ">“Lovin’ Is Bible”</a>. In 2018, they toured North America supporting COIN in the winter, X Ambassadors in the spring and 5 Seconds of Summer in the fall but are kicking off 2019 as headliners. Supporting The Aces is joan, an indie-pop duo from Little Rock, AR who most recently released their single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrBXLfKDFdQ">“drive all night”</a>.</p>
<p>The Cambridge show, like many of the other <em>Waiting For You</em> tour dates, had <a href="https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-aces-joan-middle-east-downstairs-tickets/8815975?REFERRAL_ID=tmfeedbuyat219208&amp;camefrom=CFC_BUYAT_219208&amp;impradid=219208&amp;impradname=Bandsintown&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;wt.mc_id=aff_BUYAT_219208&amp;utm_source=219208-Bandsintown&amp;clickid=RIJ2W92-jXkT0przuH2uSUvrUkgSvR3uMyMWQM0&amp;pl=mideastclub&amp;edpPlParam=%3Fpl%3Dmideastclub">sold out</a> soon after they went on sale late last year- one might say that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96CwkjCDMsA">just like that</a> there’s nothing (tickets) left” — so if you don’t have tickets yet, you might be able to score a reasonably-priced resale.</p>
