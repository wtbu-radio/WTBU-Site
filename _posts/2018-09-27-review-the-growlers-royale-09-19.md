_By David Taylor_

Hailing from Dana Point, California, the Growlers have reinvented their sound over their last two albums. The simplistic (lovable) beachy jangle heard in everything before _Chinese Fountain_ has transformed into synthy, beat-driven melodies led by the ever-raspier lead-singer Brooks Nielsen and music director/guitarist Matt Taylor. Just releasing their _Casual Acquaintances_ album last July, the Growlers have set off on their Beach Goth 2018 tour, carrying the post-modern psychedelic energy of their annual ‘SoCal’ festival across the country–as well as a couple lucky European cities.

Getting past the peculiar (to say the least) set with painted flames and the Dia de los Muertos Virgin Mary tucked in the corner, the Growlers “costumes” were more than enough to keep the eyes occupied. All six members of the band were dressed in jumpsuits with hand painted eight-pointed stars and inverted crosses. The black light glow reflecting off the white jumpsuits gave the illusion of ghostly-ghouls performing rather than people, especially during the lyrically eerie songs like “Empty Bones” and “Graveyards Full.” And while discussing appearances, it would be a disservice to neglect describing Brooks. For those who don’t know, the man looks like the love child of Jim Morrison and Edward Scissorhands. His comfortably awkward dancing, slicked back hair, and ‘70s pornstar sideburns truly make him one of the coolest–if not _the_ coolest–front men touring today.

The professionality (granted, limited professionality–but by Growlers standards, corporate) of the set, costumes, and newly added members of the band had a striking difference to their disheveled sneaker-wearing look when I saw them in Santa Cruz in 2016. Today, they are far more polished and have a greater theatrical element than previous years. Still, the moment the band entered the stage to Jonathan Richman’s “New England” and kicked off the show with “Love Test,” it was lack-of-business as usual. They still maintain that same laid-back, surfer dude vibe of a nostalgic, quintessentially Californian band. And, it transferred exceptionally well to the Bostonian audience. The Royale was brimming with people who loved the band as much as I do. For the entire first song, I couldn’t hear Brooks sing over the audience participation. It was fantastic, and it only got better. Fan favorite after fan favorite, _Los_ Growlers kept the momentum rolling with “Dull Boy,” “Naked Kids,” “Derka Blues,” and “Night Ride.”

Then “Dope on a Rope” started, and that got the crowd moshin’. Being 6’2 among an unusually short crowd, I had to keep my head on a constant swivel to avoid being taken out by one of the dozen crowd surfers circling like sharks around me. Song after song, the concert began losing its essence of being a concert. It turned into a ‘really rad Growlers Party’ that the band decided to host. One unique individual with a broken leg got the band’s attention by waving his crutches in the air. Brooks quickly grabbed a crutch and pulled him up on stage. The guy did a little jig (as only a boy dancing with one leg can) and jumped off into the crowd, with no one there to catch him. He promptly stood up from the floor, and Brooks told us “Don’t worry, he’s alright everybody. In the leg, not in the head.” The barrier between the band on stage and the audience below dissolved. We felt like we were watching a friend up there–not musical idols (as The Growlers are in my opinion).

It’s a rare opportunity to see a band that internalizes its salty, sandy California heart as well as this band does. It’s even more rare to find a band that is able to translate their inclusivity and love for performing with the audience as well as the Growlers. Whether you were one of the lucky fans who jumped up on stage to do a makeshift cabaret with Brooks or you just remained in the mosh, you spent the night _with_ Los Growlers, not watching them.
