**OLIVIA TRUGLIA**

COM - Film and Television (‘19)

Left of the Dial (Mondays 4-6)

**So, how’d you get involved in WTBU?**

I was a transfer student and I didn’t know anyone and I just really wanted to get involved so I became an intern on Casual Vibes last year.

**What’s your favorite thing about being a DJ?**

I love playing and discovering new music, but most of all I love, being with other people that appreciate music.

**What music are you into right now?**

I've been listening to the new Beck album Colors, but also going deep, I think the archives of Neil Young.

**Okay, now here are some rapid fire music questions:**

**All time favorite artist?**

Stevie Nicks

**All time favorite song?**

American Girl by Tom Petty

**All time favorite album?**

Right now, it’s Something to Tell You by HAIM. All time would be, Live at Folsom Prison by Johnny Cash.

**Most overrated artist?**

Recently overrated has to be Taylor swift for thinking she's believable as this new pop

thug persona.
