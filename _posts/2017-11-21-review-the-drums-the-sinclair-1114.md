I’ll save you the trouble of reading the many drum puns and jokes I planned to incorporate throughout this review of the appropriately titled indie pop band, The Drums. This past Tuesday, The Drums graced the stage of the Sinclair. They weren’t late or early, but _on beat_, for the entirety of the show (sorry, I just had to).

The Drums were greeted by both “die-hard” fans and introductory-level fans. Taking a look at the crowd, you could clearly see the diversity. Some were buzzing and jumping whilst mouthing the words. Even those on the top balcony were bouncing around with excitement. Half way during the set, The Drums banged out all their hits like “Days,” “Money,” and “Let’s Go Surfing.” The crowd became even more energized to the familiar beats as they sang along.

A portion of this review should definitely be dedicated to Johnny Pierce, the vocalist. His voice, his dancing, and his energy were the beats to my drum (I lied. There are drum jokes). Each song was celebrated by Pierce’s natural and effortless body rolls accompanied by mic swinging and hip swivels. His moves could only be described as fluid and effervescent. With hands poised in the air, you could not help yourself but to copy him. Decked out in coveralls, Pierce’s laid back dancing emphasized his on-point falsetto. He captured the audience with his high energy.

You would expect that a band that calls themselves The Drums would flourish their songs with intense drum work. Although this may be the case with their first, self-titled album and _Portamento,_ their second album, they take a different turn especially in their newest album, _Abysmal Thoughts_. Every song starts with a unique guitar line that captivates the audience. The connection between Danny Lee Allen, the drummer, and Tom Haslow, the guitarist is charged. Haslow would face Allen and both would feed off each other’s playing. The crowd loved it!

The Drums are the champions of pairing sad lyrics and meanings with upbeat, carefree melodies. “Blood Under My Belt,” a fan favorite, best exemplifies this. The song is essentially a heartbreak song about Pierce’s divorce, but disguised as a side-stepping and head-banging hit. Other songs from the new album are just as personal. “Head of the Horse” is about Pierce's parents’ disapproval of him coming out. The crowd connected personally with certain lyrics over others.

The Drums came to Cambridge and did not disappoint. The audience welcomed an electric, enjoyable performance. You could even say that The Drums were a _hit!_
