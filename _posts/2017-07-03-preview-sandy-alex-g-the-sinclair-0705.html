<p>Once the king of Bandcamp releases and bedroom indie, (Sandy) Alex G (formerly just Alex G) is now onto his fifth official album, <em>Rocket</em>, which was released this past May. Over the course of his young but substantial career, songwriter Alex Giannascoli has managed to tap into a variety of styles while maintaining his signature solemn, driving sound. In <em>Rocket</em>, Giannascoli explores even further. Tracks like “Bobby” and “Powerful Man” take on a folky edge with crying fiddle lines and nostalgic melodies, while “Sportstar” is a dreamy electronic daze. No matter the track (or the album for that matter), there is always the constant of Giannascoli’s raw honesty and vocals showcased in their fullest glory.</p>
<p>(Sandy) Alex G will stop at the Sinclair on July 5 to tour <em>Rocket</em>, and will be supported by Japanese Breakfast and Cende. Doors for the sold out show are at 7 p.m.</p>
