<p>WTBU's Reed Romanko sat down with Glen Ridge, New Jersey band Strange Weekend to discuss their history, music, and goals for the band. Strange Weekend is Simon Ogilvie (vocals/guitar), Aiden O'Connor (drums), and Oliver Turiano (bass).</p>
<p>REED ROMANKO: So, what ​is ​Strange Weekend?<br />
SIMON OGILVIE: Well—<br />
AIDEN O’CONNOR: He’s givin’ the candid answer to you.<br />
SO: [Laughs] Well, I mean, it started as me and Oliver always kind of writing songs together since we were in eighth grade or whatever, but Aiden and Oliver both know each other from— OLIVER TURIANO: Band, like marching band and all that, so then we were kind of like, wait a minute, we can combine and do something, so then it kinda just evolved through that way, and—<br />
SO: And like, end of 2016—<br />
OT: Yeah, we formed at the end of 2016—<br />
AO: Do we want to talk about Tituba’s Innocence?</p>
<p>RR: Do it! Yeah, talk about it!<br />
SO: Alright, so we were in a band before called Tituba’s Innocence, with Kedar Ramanathan. I played guitar, Olly played bass... it was kind of more of a joke band.<br />
OT: It ​wasa​ joke band! And then half way through we were like, “Maybe this shouldn’t be a joke band.”<br />
SO: Kedar went to college, and we were like, “Alright, we should start making some real music now.</p>
<p>RR: Okay, that’s fun.<br />
SO: We kind of just rode off of songs Me and Oliver have already wrote, and we just...</p>
<p>RR: Built it up from there?<br />
SO: Yeah, exactly, we built it up from there.</p>
<p>RR: Alright, awesome! With that said, who is Strange Weekend? Tell me a little about yourselves. Who are the people behind Strange Weekend?<br />
SO: I’m Simon Ogilvie, I play guitar and I sing, write songs...</p>
<p>RR: So you’re the primary songwriter you’d say?<br />
SO: Well, it’s a mix... We all collaborate a little bit, but it’s mostly me and Oliver, Aiden gives a lot of good advice.<br />
OT: He does.<br />
AO: [​Laughs​] I’m always there for advice.</p>
<p>RR: Alright.<br />
OT: I’m Oliver Turiano, and I started off as a drummer, I still am [laughs], but once I was just like, “Oh sh*t, Aiden plays drums... I guess I gotta play something else now!” And also I didn’t<br />
want to be a drummer and like a singer/songwriter, so I started learning guitar, and now I play guitar and bass in the band.</p>
<p>RR: And finally...<br />
AO: I’m Aidan O’Connor, and I play drums for these guys, for us, yeah... I do back up vocals, we all kinda sing.<br />
OT and SO: Yeah, we do. [​Laughs​]<br />
AO: Yeah, I’m a drummer. I go to film school in Chicago, I study music too.<br />
SO: Aidan’s been writing up a new song for us. AO: We’ve been working on a music video.</p>
<p>RR: Oh, exciting! Are we gonna get a little sneak peek tonight?<br />
OT: Oh, that would have been nice. [​Laughs​]<br />
SO: But we’re all multi-instrumentalists.<br />
OT: Yeah, like Aidan could write a bass part, or Simon could write a guitar part, or I could think up a cool drum part, so we can all trade around a little bit.</p>
<p>RR: Oh, that’s dope!<br />
OT: We all play everything, and we’re all terrible singers.<br />
SO: I mean, I’m calling myself a guitar player before anything else, and then bass is a secondary thing for me. I do really enjoy playing the bass as well.<br />
AO: I’d say I’m a storyteller. [​Laughs]​<br />
SO: Your main thing is drumming.<br />
AO: Yeah, I play drums, I’m a naturally drummer.</p>
<p>RR: So in that vein of dabbling in each other’s instruments, have you considering going beyond that, maybe picking up a horn, or—<br />
SO: Oh Jesus...<br />
OT: In a couple songs, or two, or actually one, I use a synth, but in a lot of the songs, we actually use like strings and other arranged instruments, so we have some random piano stuff, a lot of synth stuff...<br />
SO: In a new song, Aidan’s gonna be playing bass, and Olly’s gonna be up on drums.<br />
AO: We’re going to have a little switch around, should be pretty cool.<br />
SO: We’re always into playing other instruments, you know — I could have thought of something on the guitar that Olly couldn’t have, and Olly could have thought of something that I couldn’t think of. Bringing out different ideas, collaborating, you know.</p>
<p>RR: Of course! Very important. So, what would you say is your biggest musical inspiration?<br />
AO: What we’re listening to right now.<br />
OT: I mean, at least for me — and I’d probably say for your guys, but I can’t speak for you — whatever I’m listening to at the moment is gonna be what I write from.<br />
SO: Yeah, whatever we’re listening to usually informs what I’m going to be writing about.</p>
<p>RR: Alright, so could you give me some examples?<br />
SO: Bands we’re all really into, Arctic Monkeys—</p>
<p>RR: A classic.<br />
OT: It’s kinda what we grew up on...<br />
SO: A huge guitar influence for me is Johnny Marr from The Smiths.<br />
AO: My Bloody Valentine.<br />
SO: That’s how we got into all the pedals. I really like Ryan Jarman, guitar player for The Cribs.</p>
<p>OT: Recently, I know I’ve listened to a lot of ‘80s stuff, like Prefab Sprout, Aztec Camera, you know, ‘80s “sophisti-pop” if you will.<br />
AO: Oh, of course there’s our boy, Shinner, supporting us.<br />
OT: They’re a go-to.</p>
<p>RR: In terms of lyrics, I know you all contribute your own little bit, what inspires the words you guys say in the songs?<br />
SO: Well, we wrote a lot of songs when we were seventeen, eighteen living in a suburban town...A lot of experiences from that.<br />
AO: Past relationships and stuff, the classic—<br />
OT: You know, the classic teen lyrics, but we always try to make them somewhat more tongue and cheek, satiristic, you gotta love that.<br />
SO: But nothing too heady.<br />
OT: No, nothing too heady! [​Laughs]​<br />
AO: I wouldn’t call myself a lyricist, but I do enjoy writing lyrics.<br />
OT: We like to make lyrics that people can shout along to, like those ​fat choruses.</p>
<p>RR: ​Fat ​choruses!</p>
<p>OT: With a “ph.”</p>
<p>RR: So what’s the end goal with you guys, for Strange Weekend?<br />
OT: I mean, goal for right now, I think we really enjoy putting on local shows that a lot of our friends can come to, and especially mixing the crowds of certain groups and certain friends.</p>
<p>SO: We want to put on a good time for everyone, we don’t want to single anyone out.<br />
OT: I don’t think we’ve ever been like, “We gotta get this because we gotta get huge.”<br />
SO: We’re still thinking on very small level right now. Obviously, obviously, we’d love to— OT: To be indie famous!<br />
SO: Obviously, I’d love to dropout of college and go on tour.<br />
OT: Oh perfect!<br />
SO: Right now we’re just a bunch of dudes playing some rock and roll.<br />
AO: Right now we’re playing, recording songs for our friends, we’re just having a good time. OT: Building up a local following, for us and our friends!</p>
<p>RR: Nice, I respect it. And on that note, thanks! I wish you the best of luck in your performance tonight.<br />
AO, OT, and SO: Thank you!<br />
AO: And thank you BU!</p>
