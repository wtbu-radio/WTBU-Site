“_I go to a friend of a friend's party / everyone's well-dressed with a perfect body / and they all have alternative haircuts and straight white teeth / all I see is just more of the same thing,_” Caroline Rose sings on the first track, “More of the Same,” of her sophomore album _LONER_. In an album “as manic as I am,” Rose covers topics that range between death and accidental pregnancy and blends her dark humor with pop beats that she has arranged herself. While Rose takes inspiration from artists like Blondie, Justin Timberlake, and Kate Bush, _LONER_ is a sound she can call her own.

Caroline Rose is playing Great Scott on Wed. April 4, and will be accompanied by Vermont singer-songwriter Henry Jamison; tickets can be purchased [here](https://www.axs.com/events/347364/caroline-rose-tickets?skin=greatscott). Her second album, _LONER_, comes out this Friday, March 23.
