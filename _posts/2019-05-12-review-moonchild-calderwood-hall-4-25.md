On Thursday night, alternative R&B trio Moonchild performed in the Calderwood Hall at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum as part of the RISE music series, for which local rising stars and established musicians perform. In Calderwood Hall, people are able to enjoy a concert experience in a beautiful and unique venue.

Moonchild, a Los Angeles based trio made up by Amber Navran, Max Bryk, and Andris Mattson, delivered an engaging and impressive performance that had the audience dancing in their seats all the way through to the last song, when the crowd stood up to give the funky beat the dance moves it deserved.

It is rare to see a group whose members are each musically talented enough to play so many different instruments. Navran, the vocalist of the trio, also played sax and flute during the performance, while the other two members showed off their skills on horns and keyboard.

Moonchild played songs from their albums, including Voyager and Please Rewind, as well as one cover and their most recent single, “Get To Know It”. The group seemed genuinely thrilled to be performing in such a singular space. Navran in particular stuck out with her infectious smile and bubbly personality. It was lovely to see a group who clearly love the music they make, and love to share it with others.
