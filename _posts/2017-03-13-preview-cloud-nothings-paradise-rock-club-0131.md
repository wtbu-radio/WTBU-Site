Cleveland garage pop band Cloud Nothings will be coming to play Paradise Rock Club on Jan. 31 in Boston, Mass. They will be supported by LVL UP.

Cloud Nothings is touring their fourth full-length album, _Life Without Sound_, which was released today_. _For frontman and formative member Dylan Baldi, the album represents “finding \[his\] place in the world.” Even sound-wise it’s evident Baldi has taken a journey; the distorted lo-fi sound of his early works now takes on a cleaner edge while still cherishing some of the old scuzzy charm.

The show next Tuesday begins at 8 p.m. _Life Without Sound _is available on Spotify and iTunes.
