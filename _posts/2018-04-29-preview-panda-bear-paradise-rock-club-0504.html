<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panda Bear—the stage name of Noah Lennox, best known for his work as a member of critically acclaimed Baltimore band Animal Collective—will be performing at the Paradise Rock Club on Friday, May 4. Panda Bear is touring in support of January’s vinyl-only EP </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Day With the Homies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as a new album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BOUY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the details of which have not been officially announced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His upcoming concert is part of a US tour that follows a string of European dates last month, during which he played, among some older tracks, a total of nine new songs which are presumed to make up </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BOUY</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new material marks a departure from his previous sound, featuring prominent acoustic guitars as in earlier Animal Collective and solo releases, but warped and sampled to create a more electronically experimental sound.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the show will be fellow Animal Collective member Geologist, who has only recently begun to explore a solo career and has not yet officially released any music under his own name. However, at the show he will be selling a limited-edition cassette, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live in the Land of the Sky </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">EP, which was recorded last fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panda Bear’s upcoming Boston show will be at 8 p.m., and tickets are available </span><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/panda-bear-paradise-rock-club-boston-ma/venueartist/8227/1410687"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or at the box office.</span></p>
