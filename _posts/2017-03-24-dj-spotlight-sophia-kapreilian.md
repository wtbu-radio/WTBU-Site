Sophia Kapreilian

The Alternative Kids, Mondays 8-10am

Major: Behavior and Health, Minor: Advertising

**What are you listening to right now? Artists? Genres?**

I am listening to a lot of Cold War Kids, Spoon, Milky Chance, Sylvan Esso, the Lumineers

**What is your favorite record that you own?**

Hmm that’s hard. The one that I listen to the most and that I adore is Continuum by John Mayer. I listen to that all the time on my record player.

**What is your biggest piece of advice to people? In other words, what have you learned about yourself in these past 2 years at BU?**

I’ve definitely learned, get a core group of friends that you can trust and that you can know well who will always have your back. I feel like that really is the basis of your experience in college. I’m not saying if you don’t have friends then you won’t have fun or anything, I’m just saying a core group is healthy.

**What made you want to join WTBU?**

I wanted to go in right from the get-go. Going into college, I knew I wanted to join the radio. So I just went for it. I went to the meetings even though I didn’t know anybody and I was an intern for a show called Internet Killed the Radiostar. I really liked it. I learned how to do all the controls. I honed in on my inner radio voice.

**How would you describe your radio voice?**

I just put more thought into my words, and I enunciate my words. I’m just more myself. You can’t plan it. I mean obviously I give myself bullets, because we talk about artists on the air. We highlight a certain artist every week, so I bullet certain points about that. But everything else is improv and I think that’s the best way I can do it.

**What have you gained from being in WTBU?**

I definitely think being on the radio has been a segway for me to find my other interests. I never would have found out that I was so passionate about music, I don’t think. Being a DJ is spending time picking songs and really analyzing artists. I found myself really putting in a lot of effort into that. So if I didn’t start doing that I don’t think I would have even gotten into producing my own beats. I kind of know that I want music to be my future, despite my major right now. I don’t think I would have discovered that if I didn’t join WTBU. So, thanks past me. Thanks WTBU.
