<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Jillian Napolitano</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8:31pm. The lights dim as the <em>Star Wars</em> theme begins to echo through Brighton Music Hall. The bass drops, making the entire crowd screams and pushes forward. Bryce Vine steps on stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vine opens the show with “On The Ball,” an upbeat bop that makes the entire crowd dance and smile. Next up is his hit song “Sunflower Seeds,” resulting in the entire venue to roar, making it nearly impossible to hear Vine himself. The lyrics “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty ounces and a pack of ranch sunflower seeds” have never been sang as loudly as it was during this show, and it was obvious that Vine was very excited to see so many people having the time of their lives to a song that he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vine begins to introduce his band, Lucky Dave, who was wearing a sling due to his drunken adventures the night before, yet continued to whip out various instruments the entire show, including a trumpet, and drummer, Al Cleveland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vine was visibly in awe when the crowd knew one of his lesser known jams, “Where The Wild Things Are.” From the beginning to end, attendees were singing like a chorus during Vine’s set. His dedicated fan base brings a fun and carefree atmosphere to the show, allowing for a fantastic display of love between fan and artist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the final chords to Vine’s hit song, “Glamorada,” are played, Vine steps off stage. The crowd instantly chants his name calling him back. The signature tune to “Drew Barrymore” begins and the crowd goes nuts. Vine’s hit has reached over 25 million streams, and has instantaneously put him on the path to being a household name. Everyone at the gig, including staff, knew this song. The show ends with the song that originally put him on the market: “Sour Patch Kids.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vine’s entire set lasted around one hour and fifteen minutes, premiering three new songs, and teasing that his new album will be released this summer and that his first single off of the album, La La Land, will be released in “a few weeks.” His set was extremely packed and full of all original songs, even though he has yet to release a debut album — although he did mention that it will be released this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vine brought lots of enthusiasm and charm to the stage, making sure the entire crowd was engaged and having a great time. His extremely tall stature allowed for everyone in the venue to see him as he sang his heart out — even those who are under 5 feet tall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vine allows for everyone and anyone to be absorbed into the show and have a fantastic time, including an older man who began jumping and pushing toward the front with his teen children. All are welcome, all enjoy and love Bryce Vine. Next time he’s in town, make sure to grab yourself a ticket because it will be the concert of the season. </span></p>
