<p><em>By Jack Beck</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spice up your Thursday night at the Somerville Theatre, where coming this week we have Girlpool, Porches, and Palberta all in the same night. The trio will be about a week into their fall tour of the Northeast when this show arrives, all three coming off fresh releases in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Girlpool duo have the most recent release of the three, having dropped two singles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month with “Lucy” and “Where You Sink.” These new tracks show the band making big steps from their 2017 album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powerplant</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, moving towards a grander, almost shoegazey sound. But even with the anthemic builds and onslaughts of echoing guitars, Girlpool still find a way to keep that comfy intimacy of their early drum-free bedroom pop recordings and get the best of both worlds. Expect lots of reverb, catchy hooks, and rekindled memories of the best friend from kindergarten that you haven’t seen in a decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you need to dance that nostalgia away, Aaron Maine’s project Porches is just for you. The band is a perfect pair for Girlpool, mixing a similar bedroom pop coziness with fully fleshed-out and sparkling dance rock. The band’s recent music tends to be on the syntheir end of the spectrum then the other two acts here, with their release from earlier this year </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fittingly embracing house-influenced beats behind autotune soaked earworm hooks. They’ve got a real spacey, underwater aesthetic to their sound, the type of thing that would absolutely mesh with Girlpool’s brand of nostalgic, vibey indie rock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how does the Boston-native trio Palberta fit in with these two rising indie stars? Absolutely no idea. While they’re newest release </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roach Goin’ Down</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> managed to dial back slightly on the abstract excursions into musique concréte and mangled Bee Gees covers, it’s still got that fiercely unpredictable wildness that made their 2017 release </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bye Bye Berta </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my personal favorite of the year. The band’s sound is essentially the antithesis of the mellowed-out indie of Porches and Girlpool, and it’s gonna be kinda wild seeing how it all fits together. Grab your tickets </span><a href="https://www1.ticketmaster.com/porches-girlpool/event/010054DE4E46E81E"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! The show starts at 8 p.m., Thursday Oct. 25 at the Somerville Theatre. </span></p>
