Four hours and two buses later was what it took to arrive at the Pearl Street Nightclub in the small, picturesque town of Northampton, Massachusetts. The 500 capacity venue was in the basement of an unmarked building located down a dark, somewhat sketchy alleyway. The windows and doors were covered in stickers and posters, and the room looked as if it was falling apart. Thirty minutes after waiting inside, two boys dressed in overalls stepped on the stage. The Little Rock, Arkansas based synth pop duo calls themselves joan. Suddenly, shades of pink overwhelmed the stage and a ‘90s pop vibe rang throughout the venue. Their sound is similar to that of The 1975’s second studio album, _I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It,_ and the lead singer’s voice sounded eerily like Paul Klein’s from LANY. They performed the two singles that have previously been released, along with many unknown songs. The band continuously kept the crowd entertained and dancing. During one song, the lead singer asked the crowd, “Is it cool if I play the guitar for a bit?” The audience screamed in response, letting him know it was alright. He stepped forward and played an incredible guitar solo. They ended their set with one of their most upbeat songs and everyone in the room danced along.

After a short wait, the lights went out and, one-by-one, four guys appeared on stage. COIN, the Nashville-based indie pop band, walked onto the stage. They opened with their song “Hannah,” off the recently released second album, _How Will You Know If You Never Try_. The lead singer, Chase Lawrence, belted out one hit after another until they played “Don’t Cry, 2020.” The bassist, Zachary Dyke, broke a string, but the band had a backup plan while the bass was being fixed. Lawrence sang a stripped-down version of the song “I Would,” off their first studio album _COIN_. The crowd cheered as the song began as it was a nice break from the constant movement and upbeat songs. Dyke’s instrument was quickly salvaged, and the band continued with the danceable song, “Miranda Beach.”

Throughout the night the band played their well-known hits “I Don’t Wanna Dance,” “Talk Too Much,” and the always requested “Time Machine.” Shockingly, the band did not play their first single “Run,” which is the first of their songs to earn the band some fame. They slowed the mood down with crowd favorite “Malibu 1992,” and as Lawrence leaned the microphone into the crowd, the whole audience sang back the last line: “Twenty years it seems you’ve forgotten / Malibu ‘92.” The band ended the concert with “Fingers Crossed,” and Lawrence stepped out into the crowd and joined us for the entire song. Every person in the room jumped along with him and screamed the lyrics.

COIN put on an electrifying set that kept the crowd on their feet. You can catch them back in Boston on Feb. 13, 2018 at the Paradise Rock Club!
