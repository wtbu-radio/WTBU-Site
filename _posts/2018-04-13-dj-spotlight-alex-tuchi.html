<p><em>Interview by Hannah Schweitzer </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Alex Tuchi, </span><span>Hollywood Ketchup (Wednesdays from <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1472018833" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">8-10 PM)</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>What are you listening to right now?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Right now, I’m listening to a few things. I’ve been really into the new Decembrists album because I’m such a sucker for anything remotely indie folk. I’ve also got Alabama Shakes, Raury, Glen Hansard/Swell Season/The Frames, The Mountain Goats (obviously), Kings of Convenience, Ella Mai, clipping. and a TON of musicals in heavy rotation.</span></p>
<p><span><b>What is your radio show about?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Hollywood Ketchup is about a lot of things. Love. Loss. But mostly it’s about whatever is on our minds that day. Most recently, we had an Oscars recap and a “no-theme” episode because we thought we had transcended beyond the necessity of a theme (over the course of that episode, we learned, sadly, that we had not).</span></p>
<p><span><b>What do you love about WTBU? What have you gained from WTBU?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I love WTBU’s willingness to try new ideas! I’m currently working on developing a story podcast with Hannah Xue (who is indescribably talented) which we plan on releasing next fall! I never thought I could create something like that, and probably never would have without all of the internal support from friends and leadership at WTBU. And from this experience, I’ve learned to ask for what I want creatively. Oftentimes, people are really willing to try new things if you just ask!</span></p>
<p><span><b>What inspired you to start your radio show?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I was inspired to work on Hollywood Ketchup by Claudia DeTrempe, the undisputed queen of COM. We had mutual friends before I came to BU, and she’s been an absolute blessing in terms of connecting me to people and places within COM. She invited me to intern on the show first semester, and I had such a swell time with her and her co-DJ, Juliet Beauchamp, that I decided to stay.</span></p>
<p><span><b>How would you describe your radio voice?</b></span></p>
<p><span> I think I probably sound cooler on the radio. It’s kind of like my regular voice is Urkel and my radio voice is Urquelle, if that makes sense. Is Family Matters too niche?</span></p>
<p><b>If you were best friends with any celebrity or artist, who would you be best friends with?</b><br />
<span></span></p>
<p><span>This is a tough one, but only because I’m a big proponent of the idea that you should never meet your heroes. But I think if I realistically did have the opportunity to be friends with any artist, I would be remiss if I didn’t pick Donald Glover. I’ve always been the kind of person who wants to do everything, and he’s definitely the epitome of what I want to be today. He’s just so damn good at everything he does. And he was really the first person I had seen who took all of the rules that said, “you have to pick one thing; just be a writer or actor or musician” and broke those. The way he transcends labels is something I really aspire to as well.</span></p>
<p><span><b>If you were any type of food, what food would you be and why?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I think I would probably be a plum. Because no one really sits down and thinks, “You know what? I’m really hungry for a plum right now,” but when offered a plum, most people will jump at the opportunity and then remember how delicious plums are. I think we’re all subconsciously thinking about plums most of the time. Or maybe that’s just me.</span></p>
<p><span><b> Do you have any hidden talents?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I can jump really high. Like, really high. Growing up, I was a classic theatre kid and I loved musicals. The only problem was that I couldn’t dance to save my life. So I learned a lot of tumbling and falls; things that would make me funny because the funny people never have to dance well. And from practicing that, I figured out I had a pretty good vertical jump. I think maybe I’ve lost some of it, seeing as college doesn’t provide a lot of opportunities for jumping, but last I checked, I can still touch rim on a regulation hoop.</span></p>
