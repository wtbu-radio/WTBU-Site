After making a name for himself with his hit single “Brazil” in 2015, British singer-songwriter Declan McKenna released his first full-length album, _What Do You Think About the Car?_ on July 21, 2017.

The best way to describe McKenna’s vibe is semi-sweet. With amazing vocals and a smile that even your parents would approve of, Declan uses his charm and talent to speak up for what he believes in and is a true contender to be the voice of a generation. Instead of being a product of media or forcefully fighting against it, he takes his songwriting and lyricism to acknowledge the issues of the modern age and encourage change.

McKenna opens the album with an audio clip of his sister asking him “Dec, what do you think about the car?”, giving the album its unique title. In the clip, he responds, “It’s really good, and now I’m going to sing my new album.” This audio clip serves as almost a highlight to McKenna’s youth, since he was only 16 when “Brazil” gained international attention and was 18 at the time of the release of the album. While his age is often highlighted when discussing his success, McKenna proves to be one of the most mature and attentive songwriters of this era of indie-rock. He is one of the few artists who doesn’t shy away from criticizing niche political and world issues, such as calling out FIFA and the FIFA 2014 World Cup in “Brazil” and detailing the misrepresentation of transgender teens in media in “Paracetamol.” The latter song, in fact, was written in response to the suicide of transgender teen Leelah Alcorn.

While he hits on harder issues with certain songs, McKenna makes sure that this album will get you dancing around your room like you’re the star of the latest teen rom-com. “Why Do You Feel So Down,” the ninth track on the album, features upbeat synth and a beat that could hypnotize. In the music video for the song, released in October of 2017, McKenna dances in sync with a company that will take you back to an ‘80s jazzercise class… even if you never lived through the ‘80s.

Another shinier and more cheery song off the album is “The Kids Don’t Wanna Come Home,” returning to the aforementioned feeling of youth. Children sing the backing vocals to lyrics that criticize parents for misleading their children and raising them incorrectly. He recognizes that while adults may attempt to help their kids, they don’t give their children a voice in politics or social opinions. At the end of the track, there’s a recording of McKenna having a discussion with one of the children in the chorus. It truly embodies not only the youthful vibe carried throughout the album, but also shows how candid and honest he’s willing to be to his listeners.

McKenna finishes the record with “Listen to Your Friends,” produced by Rostam Batmanglij, artistically known as Rostam and best known for his former work with Vampire Weekend. He repeats “_please trust in me_” after some of the most powerful spoken-word lines to be released in 2017. He lists the problems of the world and how hypocritical the government can be, especially to youth. The song is ultimately a powerful ending to a core-shaking album.

Declan and his debut album are truly a powerhouse, and not to be missed. He will be playing at The Met in Pawtucket, RI, which is a short ride away on the commuter rail.
