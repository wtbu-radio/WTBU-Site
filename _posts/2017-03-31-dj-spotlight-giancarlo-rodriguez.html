<p>Major: Sociology with a minor in psychology in CAS.</p>
<p><strong>What are you listening to right now?</strong></p>
<p>I’m listening to Mitski, Tinashe, Busca Bulla, Cigarettes After Sex, Angel Olsen, Chromatics, and Blood Orange.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite meme at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>My favorite meme at the moment is the girl whose shadow looks like Rihanna.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to join WTBU?</strong></p>
<p>I decided originally to join because a lot of my friends were involved and on shows. I had grown up around a lot of music and I wanted to keep up with my interests and hobbies surrounding music. I began doing it with my good friend Mariel. I interned sophomore year and got a show junior year.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like to do outside of WTBU?</strong></p>
<p>I love watching movies and being with friends. I also LOVE Ru Paul’s Drag Race. Other activities I enjoy doing is exploring and looking at queer art.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you shook right now?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, the stats exam that I have tomorrow.</p>
