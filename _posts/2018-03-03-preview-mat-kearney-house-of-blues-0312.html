<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based in Nashville, singer-songwriter Mat Kearney has led a successful and exciting career thus far and has big plans for what’s next.  The future of 2018 for Kearney brings the release of his fifth studio album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRAZYTALK</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from which the Oregon-born singer has previously released four singles, “Better Than I Used To Be,” “Face to Face,” “Don’t Cry For Me,” and “Kings and Queens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kearney last released new music in 2015 with his album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Kids, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">making this upcoming album a much-anticipated new release. New single “Better Than I Used To Be” came as a result of Kearney’s collaboration with AFSHeeN, an electronic producer who has worked with big names including Selena Gomez and Galantis. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullet,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the singer’s debut album, was released in 2004 and Kearney has since been evolving and morphing his sound and style in his four successive albums. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRAZYTALK</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is projected to continue Kearney’s trend of genre-blending and infusing various techniques into his music.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of his forthcoming album, the CRAZYTALK tour is currently underway as it made its first stop in Spokane, Wash. on Feb. 19 and will run for two months ending in Dallas on April 8.  Kearney brings the tour to House of Blues Boston on March 12, 2018. Doors open at 6 p.m. and the show begins at 7 p.m. Andrew Belle and Filous are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">featured as main support on the tour. </span></p>
