_By Emma Kopelowicz_

Hippo Campus brought their signature alt-indie “happy-go-lucky” sound to the House of Blues on Saturday, Oct. 26.

Since the release of their sophomore album, _Bambi_, the band has been on a promotional tour with the Districts. The opening band played a full hour before Hippo Campus got on stage, and got the crowd revved up with their indie rock hits. Once their set was over, the lights remained dim as everyone stood waiting for the boys to take the stage.

When I saw Hippo Campus back in LA in January, they played their top hits with the same sunny demeanor that radiates from their music. _Bambi_ represents a shift in the band’s typical light-hearted pop aesthetic, and this reinvention has had a sweeping effect on the band’s sound on and off stage. This new album takes the boys down a slightly less cheery path as they experiment with layers of nuanced sounds and lyrics that shed light on more serious issues such as mental health and the #MeTooMovement.

A blue light washed over the crowd and turned a shade of light pink as the band took the stage at the House of Blues. An air of calmness fell over the room until the bright synth beat at the beginning of “Bambi” got everyone bouncing. Frontman Jake Luppen’s voice struck like a bell when he hit his falsetto notes, and he occasionally threw in a few riffs to compliment the new soulful energy prominent in the band’s second album.

The band kept things cool as they played their set that incorporated old and new material. The colored lights remained relatively low throughout the duration of the show, which cast a dramatic presence over the stage. This was not just another casual, alt-rock show; this was an embodiment this album’s bold and emotional mood.

_Bambi_ departs from Hippo Campus’s typical style in a few ways, but what makes this album special is its coupling of emotional lyrics with a striking use of contrasting soft and hard beats. From the new album the boys played the upbeat and cheeky song “Doubt,” and then they took things a bit little slower with “Why Even Try” and “Golden.” Nathan Stocker, the band’s guitarist, even took a turn at the mic to sing an unreleased track called  “No Pomegranates.”

One of the most powerful moments of the entire show took happened when the band played the most sonically adventurous song featured on _Bambi_. “Bubbles” starts off with a subtle backbeat and then all of a sudden an explosive wave of frenzied sound bursts through the middle of the song. I did not expect this particular song to make the cut for the tour, but I am so glad I got to experience it live as it sent an electrifying jolt through the crowd.

Hippo Campus has created a more sophisticated, atmospheric sound in _Bambi_ with the help of horn player DeCarlo Jackson’s talents and a new embrace of experimental synths. Jackson’s soulful trumpet was highlighted throughout the set during transitions, and made special appearances in old fan favorites like “South” and “Monsoon.”

The band also played a few other of their most popular hits, such as “Suicide Saturday,” “Way It Goes,” and “Western Kids” as if to remind the crowd that their sweet and humble roots are far from forgotten. While _Bambi_ may take a turn down a more sophisticated route for Hippo Campus, it’s clear that they remain just as fun and free-spirited as usual.

Luppen loves to stick his tongue out and smile as he performs, while Stocker occasionally leaves his post in front of the mic to play alongside Luppen or visit Whistler Allen up on drums or Jackson on horns, tambourine, and guitar right next door. While the band’s moody stage lighting and music may exude maturation, the boys remain undeniably just that: boys.

After an electrifying performance, the band briefly left the stage to take a breath before returning for the encore. Luppen belted out “Violet” and got the crowd jumping up and down. Then as the song began to wind down the spotlight shone down on Whistler, who beautifully finished off the song with his equally powerful voice.

It’s evident that Hippo Campus’s new sound has amplified their stage presence. _Bambi_ has given the boys a new sense of confidence, but they also remain grounded through their heartfelt melodies and energetic engagement with the crowd. Their music will always give off a warm and fuzzy feeling even with the new addition of more experimental beats.

Hippo Campus brought their heart and soul to the stage, and seeing them again reminded me why I fell in love with the band in the first place.
