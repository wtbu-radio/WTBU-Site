<p><em>By Spencer Vilicic</em></p>
<p><span>When you were ten years old, did you ever wish that you could run away into the woods and listen to your favorite music all day? Now that you are in your 20s, it’s time to realize that dream. Nestled in the Woodlands of Dover, Delaware, Firefly Music Festival returns for their eighth year this June 21-23, featuring some of 2019’s most in-demand artists. Headlining the festival this year is Panic! At The Disco on Friday, Travis Scott on Saturday, and Post Malone on Sunday. Other notable acts include Tyler, the Creator, fresh off the release of his sixth studio album </span><span>IGOR</span><span>; Vampire Weekend, with their recent studio album </span><span>Father of the Bride</span><span>; and Zedd, who’s been in some hot water lately over allegations made by Matthew Koma. In addition, you can expect appearances from Kygo, Death Cab For Cutie, Passion Pit, Brockhampton, Young The Giant, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span>Dubbed “The Great Atlantic Campout,” guests can choose to stay in one of the plethora of camping options ranging from basic tent camping to RV camping to luxurious “glamping” (glamorous + camping), with various amenities on the campgrounds completing their festival experience. With ten music stages and fun activities like intramural sports, slip ’n slides, silent discos, and art booths, festival-goers can expect non-stop entertainment all weekend long. </span></p>
<p><span>Firefly is designed to immerse guests in a streamlined, fun-filled experience from start to finish through a variety of methods. Since 2017, Firefly has been a cashless festival, so guests don’t have to worry about keeping track of their money. Whether a cashless experience is truly more convenient may vary from person to person, but money won’t be your main focus when you’re navigating the eclectic collection of over 100 unique artists coming to perform. Firefly has also developed a mobile app with daily lineups, maps, schedules, and more, to streamline your time at the festival. If you’re looking for something fun to do this summer on the east coast, grab your hammock and hydro flask and head on over to Firefly Music Festival for an unforgettable outdoor experience! </span></p>
