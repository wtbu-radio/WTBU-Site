_Interview by Hannah Schweitzer _

Carrie Sheehan, Funk Up the Folkdown (Sundays from 8-10 PM)

**School & Major:** CAS/Sociology & COM/Film/TV

**What do you do for WTBU?**

I’m the General Manager! I manage the EBoard, address conflicts within WTBU, and organize events like GSMs and live shows we might be having. Essentially, I just make sure things are running smoothly. 

**What is your radio show about?**

I’m currently on Funk up the Folkdown, the brainchild of head DJ Miranda Suarez! The show combines funk and folk and looks at the thematic and cultural connections between the two genres.

**What are you listening to right now?**

The Black Panther soundtrack, the new Shakey Graves and Kimbra and Janelle Monae, and I’m always listening to Villagers.

**What do you love about WTBU? What have you gained from WTBU?**

I met my roommate through WTBU. I have found family in the two EBoards I’ve been a part of, and I really feel, having been in so many student organizations for at least a second, that WTBU is completely unique on campus and like, across all schools period. Never has there been such a cool and genuinely kind group of people who are all so dedicated and passionate, and I’m lucky to be able to say that I’ve gained a sense of belonging here. 

**What inspired you to start your radio show?**

My intern semester at WTBU was my first semester at BU, and I was figuring a lot of things out. More specifically, I joined almost every form of club and student media organization at Splash. I was on a music show but I was also the de facto Entertainment producer on WTBU News, and I found that I loved talking and the round table format. I started my own show based on my Entertainment commentary segments, because the format gave me the opportunity to bring sociology and media together all while goofing off with my friends.

**If you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life, what song and why?**

lofi chill beats X hip hop study X waluigi

**If you could be any animal, what animal would you be and why?**

My roommate says I’d be a giant teddy bear, probably because I have an embarrassing collection of stuffed animals in our apartment. 

**If you could live in a different place every season, what four places would you live in and for what seasons**

I would live in Japan in the spring, Ireland in the summer, Boston in the fall, and New Zealand in the (American) winter (beating the system, one hemisphere change at a time)!
