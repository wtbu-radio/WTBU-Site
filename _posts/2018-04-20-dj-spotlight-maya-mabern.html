<p><em>Interview by Hannah Schweitzer </em></p>

<p>Maya Mabern, <span>Allston Pudding (Sundays from <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1472018834" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">6-8PM)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>What are you listening to right now?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Right now, I'm listening to a lot of Angel Olsen, especially her song "Sweet Dreams".</span></p>
<p><span><b>What is your radio show about?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Allston Pudding is all about local music, DIY, and newer music from up and coming artists. </span></p>
<p><span><b>What do you love about WTBU?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I love the creative freedom we have and the space that WTBU gives us to air it.  </span></p>
<p><span><b>What have you gained from WTBU?</b></span></p>
<p><span>From WTBU, I've gained not only technical skills, but oratory skills.</span></p>
<p><span><b>If you could listen to one artist for the rest of your life, who would it be and why?</b></span></p>
<p><span>If I could listen to one artist for the rest of my life, it would be Death Cab For Cutie; they're one of my all-time favorites because their songs are so dynamic and well-written/arranged. </span></p>
<p><span><b>If you had your own Ben and Jerry’s flavor, what toppings would be mixed in it?</b></span></p>
<p><span>My ideal Ben and Jerry's flavor would be root beer. Just root beer as ice cream. That's literally it. No toppings, just the root beer.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Besides WTBU, what other extracurriculars do you do? What are your hobbies?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I'm involved in other activities around campus other than WTBU, such as BU On Broadway and the Daily Free Press, our independently run student newspaper. In my spare time, I love to play guitar and piano, take photos, and watch Sex And The City</span></p>
<p><span><b>How would you describe your radio show voice?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I like to think of my radio voice as smooth and relaxed, but I have no way of knowing how it really is, since I hate the sound of my voice when it's recorded!</span></p>
<p><span><b>If you could travel anywhere in the world for a week where would you go?</b></span></p>
<p><span>If I could travel anywhere on earth, it would be Greece. I'm just fascinated by the aesthetics as well as the history.</span></p>
<p><span><b>What movie character do you relate the most with?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I can't think of a movie character that's similar to me, but the movie character I most want to identify with is the dog from "Beginners". He's the bark of reason.</span></p>
