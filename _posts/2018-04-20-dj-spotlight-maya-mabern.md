_Interview by Hannah Schweitzer _

Maya Mabern, Allston Pudding (Sundays from 6-8PM)

**What are you listening to right now?**

Right now, I'm listening to a lot of Angel Olsen, especially her song "Sweet Dreams".

**What is your radio show about?**

Allston Pudding is all about local music, DIY, and newer music from up and coming artists. 

**What do you love about WTBU?**

I love the creative freedom we have and the space that WTBU gives us to air it.  

**What have you gained from WTBU?**

From WTBU, I've gained not only technical skills, but oratory skills.

**If you could listen to one artist for the rest of your life, who would it be and why?**

If I could listen to one artist for the rest of my life, it would be Death Cab For Cutie; they're one of my all-time favorites because their songs are so dynamic and well-written/arranged. 

**If you had your own Ben and Jerry’s flavor, what toppings would be mixed in it?**

My ideal Ben and Jerry's flavor would be root beer. Just root beer as ice cream. That's literally it. No toppings, just the root beer.

**Besides WTBU, what other extracurriculars do you do? What are your hobbies?**

I'm involved in other activities around campus other than WTBU, such as BU On Broadway and the Daily Free Press, our independently run student newspaper. In my spare time, I love to play guitar and piano, take photos, and watch Sex And The City

**How would you describe your radio show voice?**

I like to think of my radio voice as smooth and relaxed, but I have no way of knowing how it really is, since I hate the sound of my voice when it's recorded!

**If you could travel anywhere in the world for a week where would you go?**

If I could travel anywhere on earth, it would be Greece. I'm just fascinated by the aesthetics as well as the history.

**What movie character do you relate the most with?**

I can't think of a movie character that's similar to me, but the movie character I most want to identify with is the dog from "Beginners". He's the bark of reason.
