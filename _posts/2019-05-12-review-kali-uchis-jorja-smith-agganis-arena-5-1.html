<p>The Kali &amp; Jorja Tour made its third stop on Wednesday night in Boston. The seventeen-show, five-week tour will span North America. Both artists are coming off massive success in 2018 due to their respective debut albums. Jorja Smith released <em>Lost &amp; Found</em> last June, which earned her the Brit Award for best British Female Solo Artist. Kali Uchis released <em>Isolation</em> last April, an album which featured on many end of the year top 50 lists. The neo-soul female duo enthralled fans with a performance that balanced power with elegance.</p>
<p>Elevated on individual platforms, Jorja Smith was accompanied by a four-piece band. She emerged from the shadows sporting a beautiful yellow silk dress with green corset. Smith skipped the formalities and jumped straight into the head bobbing “Teenage Fantasy” to open her set. She was strong yet graceful, and transitioned from soft low notes to sharp high notes masterfully. Under a low purple light, she slowly walked the stage with her head held high observing her audience. The use of lighting during her set was very well done and created vivid shadows mixed with rich colors.</p>
<p>Mirroring her albums track list, “Where did I Go” and “February 3rd” followed her opener without pause. Jorja Smith’s voice was in pristine condition and many of her songs sounded identical to the studio version. While only 21, Smith showcased veteran breath control during her rap performance of “Lifeboats.”</p>
<p>After a brief trip offstage, Smith rejoined the smoke filled stage and seemed to slow time during her gentle ballad “Goodbyes.” After performing the fan favorite “Blue Lights,” she took the time to thank Boston and introduce her bandmates. She finished her set with the up-beat “On My Mind” which allowed her to wail one last time.</p>
<p>Jorja Smith showcased her talent and maturity on Wednesday night. While still a young performer, her vocal accuracy and breath control were that of an established artist. With beautiful colors and lights Jorja finished her set blowing kisses to the crowd. With performances like these, it’s safe to say her audience will only grow.<span></span></p>
<p>Kali Uchis arrived on stage as powerful as Jorja had left it. The room was buzzing as the lights cut out and a multi-level spinning platform illuminated. While the platform spun in bright yellow, Kali Uchis posed atop the six levels like a queen. Again pointless intros were scrapped in favor of immediate impact. Opening to “Loner,” Kali Uchis brought a no-nonsense attitude and performed with tenacity. Her stage movements were precise, she wasted no breath, and performed difficult moves in tall black heels.</p>
<p>Wearing a high cut black dress wrapped in artificial chains, Uchis mirrored her co-headliner and proceeded into her next song “Dead to Me” without pause. She swayed between upbeat songs like “Just a Stranger” and slow tempo ballads like “Gotta Get Up” with ease. Uchis made an effort to connect with her fans, even making eye contact with two enthusiastic front row girls during the last verse of “Riding Round.”</p>
<p>The highlight of Kali Uchis’ set was her rendition of “Killer.” She returned to the top of the platform, this time electing to serenade from a plastic chair. Her suggestive dancing and glaring stare brought a sense of sexuality to the forefront of the show. She displayed a high level of control during “Nuestro Planeta” balancing vocals with dancing. She closed with “After the Storm” which was unfortunately interrupted by discussions with her DJ.</p>
<p>Kali Uchis is clearly a talented artist and performer. She seemed comfortable and eager to control the stage, less reliant on the mic stand than Jorja Smith. Uchis performed with the professionalism and vigor of a headliner.</p>
<p>As Uchis left the stage, the crowd cheered for an encore but alas one never came. Fans waited in anticipation for the duo to return and perform their one and only collaborative track “Tyrant”. The two never emerged and the stadium lights turned on as concert staff began to dismantle the set. It was a bitter moment to cap off an otherwise sweet experience. The dynamic duo are on their first major tour and already showing superstar potential.</p>
