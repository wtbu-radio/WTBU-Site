30-year-old Bryce Vine is best known for his breakthrough single “Drew Barrymore” that was first released in 2017 but later re-released in 2018 alongside various remixes of the same song. Vine’s “Drew Barrymore” has earned more than 140 million streams as well as being selected to perform on _Late Night with Seth Meyers._ Vine first made his mark in the music scene with his 2014 song, “Sour Patch Kids” that has received around 30 millions streams on Spotify and YouTube.

Vine’s most recent release is a collaboration with Feder and Dan Caplen, titled “Control.” Although it is a collaboration, “Control” still sounds like Vine, as he puts it “If Outkast and Blink-182 got drunk with the Gorillaz and started playing music together.” Bryce Vine is going on a 25 date North American Tour starting at the beginning of February, with 11 sold out dates, including his February 6th Boston show at Brighton Music Hall. Look out for Vine, because he will soon be a household name.
