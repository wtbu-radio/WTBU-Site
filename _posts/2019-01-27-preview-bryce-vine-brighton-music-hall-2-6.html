<p><em>By Jillian Napolitano</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30-year-old Bryce Vine is best known for his breakthrough single “Drew Barrymore” that was first released in 2017 but later re-released in 2018 alongside various remixes of the same song. Vine’s “Drew Barrymore” has earned more than 140 million streams as well as being selected to perform on <em>Late Night with Seth Meyers. </em>Vine first made his mark in the music scene with his 2014 song, “Sour Patch Kids” that has received around 30 millions streams on Spotify and YouTube.</p>
<p>Vine’s most recent release is a collaboration with Feder and Dan Caplen, titled “Control.” Although it is a collaboration, “Control” still sounds like Vine, as he puts it “If Outkast and Blink-182 got drunk with the Gorillaz and started playing music together.” Bryce Vine is going on a 25 date North American Tour starting at the beginning of February, with 11 sold out dates, including his February 6<sup>th</sup> Boston show at Brighton Music Hall. Look out for Vine, because he will soon be a household name.</p>
