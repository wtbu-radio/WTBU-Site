<p><em>Interview by Hannah <span>Schweitzer</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Danya Trommer, DJ on </span><span>Dat Brass (Thursdays from <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1950586388" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">6-8AM</span></span> )</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>What music are you listening to right now?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I've been listening to a lot of streetlight Manifesto, Jim Croce, and Elvis </span></p>
<p><span><b>If you could have dinner with any artist, who would you have dinner with and why?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I'd want to have dinner with Tomas Kalnoky, lead singer of </span><span>Streetlight Manifesto</span><span>! I'm very much in love with him and I think he's musically incredibly talented so I'd love to pick his brain about music!! </span></p>
<p><span><b>What are your favorite pizza toppings?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Sausage and bacon!! </span></p>
<p><span><b>What do you love about WTBU?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I love WTBU because I am so happy to have the opportunity to play my favorite music that doesn't get any playtime on actual radio due to being incredibly unpopular.</span></p>
<p><span><b>What inspired you to start your radio show?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I have a very strong passion for ska and I just love talking about music and just bantering so I thought it'd be super fun! </span></p>
<p><span><b>How would you describe your radio show voice?</b></span></p>
<p><span> I usually do a weird like male announcer voice. I go way into my lower register and sometimes do a smooth jazz radio voice too. It's just naturally what happens for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span><b>What’s the most embarrassing thing you have done on the air?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I burp and fart a lot on air. I feel very bad for Zoe (my cohost). I've also several times double clicked on songs when I didn't mean to and just totally cut off songs. </span></p>
<p><span><b>What have you gained from being in WTBU?</b></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve gained such great experience from hosting a show. It's also helped me realize how much I love radio as a medium. Also, since my show is at <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1950586389" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">6 am</span></span>, I've definitely learned how to make myself get up early.</span></p>
