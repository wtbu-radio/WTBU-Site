After a spending time working on new music, X Ambassadors have returned to the touring world by kicking off a short February tour. They performed a sold out show at the House of Blues in Boston on Feb. 18.

Minnesota-based indie rock duo Now, Now opened the show. The band is made up of longtime friends Cacie Dalager (vocals/guitar) and Bradley Hale (drums). Despite being sick, Dalager entertained the audience with a high energy performance and strong vocals. The band performed a collection of upbeat rock songs. After instructing the crowd to dance, Dalager introduced their newly released single “SGL.” The audience appeared to enjoy their set, but seemed ready for the main act of the night.

After a short set change, alternative rockers X Ambassadors took the stage. The group hails from Ithaca, N.Y. and is comprised of Sam Harris (vocals/saxophone), Casey Harris (keyboard), and Adam Levin (drums). They began their set with their newest single “Don’t Stay,” followed by an older favorite, “Jungle,” as the crowd roared. Harris was filled with energy and constantly moved around the stage. He spent most of the night riling up the crowd and explaining the meaning behind many of their songs.

During the song “Hang On,” Harris asked the audience to raise their hands along with him anytime he sang the line “_Put your whole five fingers on…_” Everyone followed along and he was visibly happy with the outcome. To introduce “Low Life,” Harris explained to the audience “If you’ve ever felt like you’ve had one of those days where you didn’t like what you saw in the mirror, this song is for you.”

X Ambassadors have been on the down low for over a year while they worked on new music. This tour was the perfect time for them to premiere some of the new songs: “One of the reasons we’re all here tonight is because we’re gonna play you some brand new music. Do y’all wanna hear some new music?” Harris asked while preparing to perform a song titled “Happy Home.” The song had pieces of the old X Ambassadors, but there was clearly a growth. The song featured a small choir and high notes from Harris while still having their usual heavy drum beats and keyboard. Harris introduced the next new song, “RIP,” by explaining that he has been with his fiancé for over seven years and she gives him “this look” sometimes and the song is about that look. This song was similar to that of “Fear” or “Jungle.” “Hold You Down” is about a relationship Harris had with someone who is not in his life anymore, and he is not happy with the way things were left.

They kept the high energy throughout their performance and the audience was constantly moving along. Harris’ vocals were strong and clear. He played the saxophone during a few songs, and the audience loved it. His brother had a solid night on the keys and danced along to all of their songs. Levin’s drum beats rang throughout the venue constantly and added an important element to the set.

They dedicated a song to the 17 victims of the recent Florida shooting, and Harris expressed his views: “Bottom line we need stricter gun control.” The crowd cheered in agreement and the band began a touching performance of “Unsteady.” The show ended with a note from the band, “You should never be afraid to be who you are. We are your allies, your friends, your lovers. We will protect you and always fight for your rights and we will never silence ourselves.” The band began their final song of the night, “Unconsolable” and a warm feeling was felt throughout the venue.
