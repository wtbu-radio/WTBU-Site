<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is one guarantee, it’s that Maluma knows how to deliver an intoxicating performance. Setting the tone for the concert with his first song, “23” off of his upcoming album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">F.A.M.E.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Colombia-born reggaetonero confidently sang of money and fame. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mucho carro y mucho bling bling bling</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">/ </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y del banco siempre suena el ring ring.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But under all the glamour and pyrotechnics, one moment stuck out to me that showed how sincere Maluma really is. After a break during “Corazón,” a song he did with Brazilian singer Nego de Borel, Maluma took off his shades and grabbed a bottle of water to drink. As he approached the microphone stand again, the crowd erupted with screams. Everyone was jumping up and down, screaming his trademark, “Maluma, baby.” The cameras closed up on his face, and behind the beautifully intricate metallic, red, floral suit, there was no way to hide how happy he was to be there. With his hand on his heart, Maluma’s humble, if shy, smile radiated throughout the arena as he thanked the audience for being there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston was the second stop of his F.A.M.E. tour, but Maluma treated it as it were his first and last, leaving everything out on stage. With the help of his stunning background dancers, singers, and band, Maluma was able to engage with the almost at-capacity arena. Most artists, no matter how big the venue they’re playing, find a way to connect with the audience. And if they do it well, the big space doesn’t feel as impersonal or disconnected. It was hard not to feel connected to both the rest of the crowd and Maluma during the concert, but he did extra little things to take it a step further. Towards the middle of the concert, Maluma asked his dancers to pick a woman from the crowd to come up on stage. After a quick outfit change, Maluma returned to start his serenade. The 23-year-old woman who was brought up on stage was star struck, needless to say, but managed to interact with him. He sang “El Perdedor,” and used the fact that the woman had a boyfriend to add playful drama to the performance, much like what the song is about. At the end, a kiss on the cheek turned into a kiss on the lips as he walked away. In true Maluma fashion, when he got far enough away he said in English, “I’m sorry. My bad. I promise I’m not gonna do it again.” If that isn’t enough to make anyone melt, I don’t know what is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though his stage personality is seductive and irresistible I will forever be convinced that Maluma truly performs for his fans, and loves every single one. It was evident in the way he wanted to include everyone in a special video. He asked that anyone who had a flag, sign, or merchandise of his to hold it up, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">subirlo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and his videographer would capture it on film. He wanted all his fans to know he appreciated them coming out and supporting him. He thanked everyone for their love, and asked the crowd to sing with him, continuing “Borro Cassette.” But being a performer, and a very thrilling one at that, Maluma did come to deliver a performance. My favorite part of the concert was actually when the band was incorporated in a completely different way than on the albums. During “El Préstamo,” a song newly released as a single, the electric guitar and drums gave dynamic solos so hot, I could feel the energy from where I sat. The pyrotechnics set up all around the stage might have added a little to the heat, but not by much. The rock and roll-esque shredding was a surprising, but very welcome addition to the Latin rhythms of Maluma’s music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the concert flew by in a blur of red and white confetti, and cries of “Otra, Otra, Otra,” for an encore. But when it was over, it was hard not to feel a withdrawal from the Maluma-drunk stupor. If he ever comes back to Boston, I expect nothing less than the passion he brought to Agganis Arena Saturday night. </span></p>
