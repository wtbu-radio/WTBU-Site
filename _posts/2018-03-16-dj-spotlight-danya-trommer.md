_Interview by Hannah Schweitzer_

Danya Trommer, DJ on Dat Brass (Thursdays from 6-8AM )

**What music are you listening to right now?**

I've been listening to a lot of streetlight Manifesto, Jim Croce, and Elvis 

**If you could have dinner with any artist, who would you have dinner with and why?**

I'd want to have dinner with Tomas Kalnoky, lead singer of Streetlight Manifesto! I'm very much in love with him and I think he's musically incredibly talented so I'd love to pick his brain about music!! 

**What are your favorite pizza toppings?**

Sausage and bacon!! 

**What do you love about WTBU?**

I love WTBU because I am so happy to have the opportunity to play my favorite music that doesn't get any playtime on actual radio due to being incredibly unpopular.

**What inspired you to start your radio show?**

I have a very strong passion for ska and I just love talking about music and just bantering so I thought it'd be super fun! 

**How would you describe your radio show voice?**

 I usually do a weird like male announcer voice. I go way into my lower register and sometimes do a smooth jazz radio voice too. It's just naturally what happens for some reason.

**What’s the most embarrassing thing you have done on the air?**

I burp and fart a lot on air. I feel very bad for Zoe (my cohost). I've also several times double clicked on songs when I didn't mean to and just totally cut off songs. 

**What have you gained from being in WTBU?**

I’ve gained such great experience from hosting a show. It's also helped me realize how much I love radio as a medium. Also, since my show is at 6 am, I've definitely learned how to make myself get up early.
