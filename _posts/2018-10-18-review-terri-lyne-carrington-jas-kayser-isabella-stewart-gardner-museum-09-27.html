<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three-time Grammy award winning drummer and educator, Terri Lyne Carrington, played a complex and memorable set in the four-story Calderwood Hall. Carrington and her opener, former Berklee student Jas Kayser and her band Jas &amp; Chums, had audients craning far over the barrier of each level to see what was going on below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrington’s set was part of the RISE Music Series, curated by Shea Rose and Simone Scazzocchio. RISE is working to bring pop, rock, and hip-hop into classical settings while also inspiring people to get out and enjoy music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayser’s set featured a tight band of well-read, experienced musicians. Kayser led the band with quiet confidence only broken by her sharp, precise drumming. Danny Garza and Niu Raza added to the mix with their controlled yet soulful vocals and their on-stage chemistry. Kayser expressed her utmost gratitude in opening for Carrington and for music itself between songs, giving credit to everyone in her band as well as Carrington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stage lights turned an ominous blue as Carrington’s band appeared on stage. Carrington gripped the room with the first words out of her mouth: “This is an election song.” A single spotlight then illuminated singer Debo Ray, who gave an emotional, striking performance. Through the performance, each member of Carrington’s band had their moment to show their craft. The most notable and unique aspect of Carrington’s band was Jassa Overall’s position on the turntables. Each song featured interesting musical samples and radio clips, and one song revolved completely around lines of poetry. Raw emotion flowed through Carrington’s entire set, which also featured a satirical piece about “praying the gay away.” It was evident through the set just how much experience and wisdom Carrington possessed. Her band hung onto her musical cues religiously. It was clear that they were playing to spread a message instead of playing just to be done. Carrington also made her years of experience in music and music education apparent through her near-perfect playing. She quite literally never missed a beat, even through the complicated time signatures that threw the audience for a loop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrington closed the show by bringing Kayser on stage with her. The two drummed together, arm movements and beats completely in sync. Their relationship became apparent in way their music styles meshed. Carrington did not overpower Kayser despite her years of experience; they were equal, and the two traded solos during the last number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every second of the show, including the introduction of Kayser and Carrington, was full of life and excitement. There was never a moment of bravado. Each set demanded full engagement, as each was lush and complex in its own way. Kayser and Carrington made drumming look easy. They made inaccessible musical perfection accessible, and showed the value of mastering music as a craft. They also provided prime examples of the rebirth of progressive jazz and afro-centric soul.</span></p>
