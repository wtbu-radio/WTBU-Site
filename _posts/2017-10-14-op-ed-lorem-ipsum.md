Ever since the fall of _Pitchfork_, music journalism has been really confusing for me. I don’t want to read about why a pop song I love is a 6.5 and some obscure German noise producer is a 10. This kind of cruel criticism isn’t inspiring good music anymore. _Dazed_ can’t post something without getting mocked. _The Fader_ only cares about rap, and indie magazines like _Spin_, _Consequence of Sound_, and _Brooklyn Vegan_ have virtually dedicated their audiences as 30-somethings. Living in Boston, I tried to read/write for local music-focused magazines, but there’s only so many times one can talk about Vundabar. I was lost, looking for a strongly curated voice to tell me what to listen to.

Then I found [Lorem Ipsum](https://goo.gl/4NvAq5). As someone with a short attention span and a big love for email newsletters, I was already in the ballpark for this, and once I found out about LaCroix Boi in one letter, I was convinced. Lorem Ipsum is music/food/culture letter written by Margot Boyer-Dry, a Brooklyn-based Wesleyan graduate with a biting take on popular trends. Each thrice-weekly email takes a trend that gives rise to social movements and tracks it throughout culture, like: house plants, the word “Dotard,” or why Parquet Courts collaborated with a rapper on their latest single. The newsletter often highlights emerging artists in its issues, giving equal air time and fair coverage to local artists and megastars; recent features include DRAM, Chronixx, Sinkane, and Parquet Courts. If there’s is one thing music blogging needs these days it’s some unbiased curation.

Newsletters are simply one option of the growing market of subscriptions vying for your attention. New methods of communication are starting everyday, but this one is worth watching. There’s a reason why most of its 100,000 subscribers are NY-based media makers who are passionate about music. We’ve all done our reading, and are now looking for a cool person to say what’s to hear next. Subscribing to [Lorem](https://goo.gl/4NvAq5) gives you that strongly curated voice.
