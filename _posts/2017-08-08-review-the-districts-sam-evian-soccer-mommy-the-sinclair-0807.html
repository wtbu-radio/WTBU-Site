<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of their new album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular Manipulations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being released this Friday, The Districts made a stop in Boston at the Sinclair Monday night to exhibit some fresh tracks in addition to nostalgic favorites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the Philly-based four piece took the stage, Nashville’s Soccer Mommy played their indie bedroom dream pop to a steadily growing crowd. Vocalist and guitarist Sophie Allison entranced with tracks like “Try” and “Inside Out” that wavered between driving, angst-infused guitar lines and more sonically delicate vibes. A four-piece, Soccer Mommy provided a substantial sound and full set, closed by a touching solo performance by Allison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following shortly after was NYC’s Sam Evian. Walking the line between slacker rock and dreamy psych, the band played a chilled-out but exceptionally energetic set. Between the guitar solos and between-song banter, the crowd was charmed. “Sleep Easy,” from the band’s most recent album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was a standout track with an infectious chorus and irresistible hooks. The Sam Evian’s pleasant set worked as an effective transition to the equally as likeable sound of the Districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the band took the stage, the Sinclair was fairly packed--quite the accomplishment for a Monday night show. The folk-infused pop of the Districts caught the attention of the crowd immediately, that of the die-hards and new fans alike, with “If Before I Wake,” a track from their upcoming album. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular Manipulations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be the band’s third full-length album, and the set list featured many of the tunes that are soon-to-be fan favorites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Districts didn’t overload with new material for the sake of keeping their followers engaged. “Long Distance” and “Funeral Beds” (a song once described to me as being “a certified banger even if it employs every folk-rock trope in the book”) were favorites if gauged by how loudly the crowd echoed lyrics back to frontman Rob Grote. Both tracks were from the Districts’ debut, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telephone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though they also powered through songs like “4th and Roebling” and “Youngblood” from 2015’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Flourish and a Spoil.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folk-rock tropes aside, the Districts played a genuine, heart-felt, and electric set. They mimicked the energy and enthusiasm of the crowd, and even offered some health advice in the form of sharing startling facts about the disingenuous nature of American cheese. Their connection with the people packed into the Sinclair extended beyond banter and their accessible pop sounds though; the Districts’ general stage presence--from their very dad-like fashion sense to their visible comfort of being onstage--was endearing. And when the band reached the end of their set, the fans certainly were not ready to let go just yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cue the explosive two-song encore. The Districts performed with unrestrained passion and fulfilled any lingering desire the crowd had for the folk-rock heroes. It’s fair to say that Boston adopted the Philly four-piece for the night and are looking forward to the next visit. </span><br />
