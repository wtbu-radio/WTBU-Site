Dance your blues away this Sunday, February 24th to Empress Of’s electropop R&B tunes at Brighton Music Hall! Empress Of is the music project of lyricist, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Lorely Rodriguez. Her second studio album, _Us_, was just released in October of this past year and is currently being toured. As a departure from her first self-produced album _Me_, _Us_ was a group effort between many music collaborators including Dev Hynes of Blood Orange. Rodriguez embellishes her innovative synth-y beats with clever and direct lyricism that fluctuate between English and Spanish from her Honduran roots. On top of that, she has spent ample time in Boston being a Berklee School of Music graduate. If you’re a fan of raw and honest synth pop, be sure to get your ticket soon!

Empress Of’s anticipated Boston show will start at 8:00 pm at Brighton Music Hall on Sunday, February 24th.
