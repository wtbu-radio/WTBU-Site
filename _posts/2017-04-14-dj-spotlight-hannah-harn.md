Hannah Harn

Astronomical Space Case (Thursdays 8am-10am)

COM, Journalism major

**What are you listening to right now?**

I’m listening to a lot of Cage the Elephant, La Caffetteria, Kavinsky, and the Harry Styles single.

**Your favorite planet and why?**

My favorite planet is Pluto, because it’s the most under-appreciated among the scientific community. It needs some love, ya know?

**Favorite meme?**

It’s a tie between the shocked guy and the Mr. Krabs shook meme.

**What got you to join WTBU?**

When I was walking around at splash, wtbu felt like the most fun people. The people I met there were so wonderful and at the first interested staff meeting, I could tell that everybody really wanted to be there. And I also love that nobody takes themselves too seriously. Everybody just kinda, ya know, vibes!
