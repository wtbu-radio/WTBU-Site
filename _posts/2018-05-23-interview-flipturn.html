<span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming off the release of their second EP, Florida-based Flipturn has journeyed up the East Coast on their first tour. The band is composed of Dillon Basse on lead vocals and guitar, Tristan Duncan on lead guitar, Madeline Jarman on bass, Taylor Allen on keys and guitar, and Adrian Walker on drums. This group of college students has shown extreme progress during their few years as a band, and they've solidified their sound with two driven and passionate indie rock EPs. From an initial listen of the newest EP,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Citrona</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can tell that they bring a lot to the table. There are powerful rock tracks like “Churches,” “Nickels,” and “Six Below” that balance out two softer songs, “August” and “Hippies.” Before their show at The Lilypad on May 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, WTBU DJ Monica Sucic chatted with the group about the EP, 14 hour drives, and U2. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monica Sucic: How was the release of </b><b><i>Citrona</i></b><b> different from the release of </b><b><i>Heavy Colors</i></b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madeline Jarman: We wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citrona</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to tell a story from beginning to end. With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy Colors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we were just excited to get an EP out there, so it was just the first couple songs that we wrote that we were confident enough to put out on an EP. We took our time [with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citrona</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] and made it as meaningful as we could.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: What was the hardest part of the writing/recording process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor Allen</span><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think it was being split up. Some of us are in Gainesville, Florida and some of us go to school in Jacksonville, Florida. We had to really find time in our schedules where we would all be free and we could all be in the studio together. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Why did you choose to include the quote from “Dead Poets Society” at the beginning of the album version of “Churches?”</b></p>
<p>Dillon Basse: I love that quote and I love that movie. It kind of just sets up the song. The whole meaning behind the poem is about contributing your verse–what you're going to contribute to your life–and that's pretty much what "Churches" is: finding your passion, finding what you want to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: How has tour been going so far?</b></p>
<p>All: It's been pretty good, pretty awesome.</p>
<p>DB: Friday morning we're going to be driving 14 hours back to Florida...</p>
<p>TA: But it's totally been worth it. I love being on the go and seeing different places. It's been such a fun experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: What’s been your favorite part of touring?</b></p>
<p>DB: It's been an awesome experience.</p>
<p>MJ: I've never been to Massachusetts or Philadelphia, so it's really cool to go around and look at the cities. It's been fun having Dillon as a tour guide around Boston.</p>
<p>TA: It's fun to see how different the music scenes are, too. Playing in Philly was really cool. I was not expecting that show to go the way it did, but I'm so happy it did. It was just such a cool experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MJ: We played in a basement in Philly–that was really cool. The ceiling was right here [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gestures a few inches above her head</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] so we couldn't really jump around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TA: I hit my head about four times but it was worth it. [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">laughs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span></p>
<p>MJ: We didn't really know what to expect out of any of the shows, so it's a pleasant surprise every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Which band/album had the most influence on your childhood?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TA: The first one that comes to mind is Kelly Clarkson because it's the first album I ever had on CD, but I don't really think it impacted me. [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">laughs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span></p>
<p>DB: U2 for me. When I was younger for sure.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TA: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshua Tree</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! That's my mom's favorite album by them, that and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so I was raised on those albums. I got to go see U2 with her on the Joshua Tree tour last summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MJ: The first alternative band that I got into and really resonated with me was Two Door Cinema Club, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tourist History</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I guess that was in middle school. I've always loved them, I still love them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DB: That's why she likes cats so much. [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all laugh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span></p>
<p>MJ: It's a great album cover! Also, it's not really an album, but I grew up playing all the Guitar Heroes. I feel like that made me want to go into music.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><b>MS: Which bands are you currently listening to that you'd recommend?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DB: The Districts! One hundred percent, I've said it so many times. I love them.</span></p>
<p>Tristan Duncan: Sure Sure. They're really good.</p>
<p>TA: I've been listening to a lot of Greta Van Fleet.</p>
<p>MJ: I know they're pretty popular, but Alvvays; they're one of my favorite bands.</p>
<p>Adrian Walker: Definitely Frank Ocean. I grew up listening to heavier stuff like classic rock, but recently I've had more of an appreciation for R&amp;B.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who would it be?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AW: Freddie Mercury.</span></p>
<p>TA: All I can think of is Freddie Mercury, because we watched the trailer for the new Queen movie that's coming out. Or Dave Grohl. I just wanna be his best friend.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b><b>MS: If you could get a tattoo for any song, album, or band, what would it be and why?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TA: The Maine is my favorite band, so I have quite a few planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DB: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>TA: Ok! Judgement free zone! But the two specific ones are 8123, which is the label they created, and I've made a lot of friends through the 8123 family and I actually got to see one of my friends who I met through The Maine two days ago at one of our shows. The other one would be "raw and invincible" which is a line from one of their songs.</p>
<p>MJ: Probably either a Hippo Campus quote or Alvvays. They both have really good lyrics.</p>
