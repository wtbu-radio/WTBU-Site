<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vocalist-guitarist Jilian Medford has just released the sophomore album of her solo project, IAN SWEET, on Oct. 26. This new LP, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crush Crusher</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, navigates the intimate emotions of exploring identity and recognizing her place within relationships. She communicates these ideas in musings and declarations with her almost-raspy soprano voice backed by classic indie rock guitar tones and steady percussion. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crush Crusher</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a step forward for Medford creatively and professionally as it shows a departure from her more lo-fi first album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shapeshifter,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a more cleanly produced sound allowing for each element of her songs to be identifiable and pungent for the listener. IAN SWEET arrives in Boston this Saturday, Nov. 3 as a part of her North American tour for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crush Crusher.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The band originated in the Boston-based DIY scene, so this will be a special show for Medford, returning to her roots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show will be opened by Young Jesus and Sean Henry who are both accompanying her on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crush Crusher </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tour. Young Jesus is an LA-based four-piece that finds their niche in emotional indie rock embellished with experimental polyrhythms and shouted philosophical observations. They also have just released an album this month, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Whole Thing Is Just There</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next is Sean Henry, who focuses on grappling with sad, existential topics through jangly guitar sounds and simplistic lyrics reminiscent of early (Sandy) Alex G.</span></p>
