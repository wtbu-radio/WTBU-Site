Saves the Day is embarking on a cross-country tour, hot on the heels of the release of their latest album, _9_. The album is a reflection on where Saves the Day has been, as well as the progress lead singer and songwriter Chris Conley has made since the release of their first record. In this regard, _9_ is an album that references back to older material while still bringing a fresh take on Saves the Day. Conley even remarked to Billboard that it’s “really enjoyable” to be able to bring older motifs and lyrics back to new music. Bringing this music to the live stage, then, harkens back to the energy of classic Saves the Day without losing their modern edge.

It was clear that the centerpiece of the night was _9_. The stage backdrop was a full-sized banner of the album cover, and five songs from the setlist were from _9_, more than any other album featured. However, there wasn’t a complete departure from previous material. The band opened with “At Your Funeral,” the lead single from their 2001 album _Stay What You Are_. Starting out with an older song rather than one from _9_ really set the tone for the night. Not only was it a celebration of the release of a new album, but a celebration of where Saves the Day has come from. Considering that _Stay What You Are_ is their highest selling album to date, it makes sense to start with a song from the album.

However, there wasn’t a lack of _9_ songs in the setlist. “Suzuki,” “Kerouac and Cassady,” and “Rosé” all made it into the first half of the setlist. The first half of the set also included selections from their 2013 album _Saves The Day_ like “Xenophobic Blind Left Hook,” _Daybreak_’s “1984,” and _Sound The Alarm_’s “Eulogy” and “The End.” Although recognizable, many of these songs fell a bit flat. They didn’t pack the punch like the songs from _9_ or _Stay What You Are_ had. Instead, they blended together without any feeling of distinction. It didn’t help that there was hardly any banter or even speaking from the band members onstage. Although this meant more music could be played overall, there were moments when I hoped for a break, even a brief one.

This isn’t to say the set was bad. Even songs that didn’t hit their mark were engaging to a degree. But, there were songs that absolutely lit up the room. “Shoulder to the Wheel,” the first song of the night to be featured from their second album _Through Being Cool_, was an instant hit. While this may be a product of the song’s popularity among fans, I would also chalk it up to the fact that the band put so much energy into it. The same can be said for “Anywhere With You” from 2003’s _In Reverie_. There was a heart and soul missing from some of the songs that was indisputably found in these songs. It was the energy of a band playing new songs for the first time, translated to some of their oldest material.

This same sentiment carried through the second half of the show. Songs like “Freakish,” “Holly Hox, Forget Me Nots,” and “It’s Such a Beautiful World”, from _Stay What You Are_, _Through Being Cool_, and _9_ respectively, showed the true passion and power of Saves the Day. Other songs from the set seemed to lean on these selections, but they held their own well enough to be interesting and enjoyable.

The encore was truly the cherry on top of the night. Featuring songs from both the oldest and youngest of the band’s albums, it showcased the unforgettable lyrics and riffs that make Saves the Day special, while also showing their growth over the last two decades. It began with Conley coming out alone to sing “Three Miles Down,” the ultimate singalong for fans. This created a striking contrast to the rest of the set: Where the earlier set relied heavily on guitar and bass riffs and crashing drums, the stripped down rendition of “Three Miles Down” allowed the song to shine in its own right. It was the only song of the night from the band’s 1998 debut album _Can’t Slow Down_. This was followed by _Saves the Day_’s “Ring Pop” and _9_’s “Side By Side”. But, like any good band, they saved the best for last. The final song of the night was “Rocks Tonic Juice Magic,” a fan favorite from _Through Being Cool_. There were no added frills or special changes the make the song last or give it an extra moment before the show ended. Instead, it was done justice by being performed as it appears on the record, giving both lifelong fans and newcomers the opportunity to experience the raw feelings of “Rocks Tonic Juice Magic”. Angry, bitter, and lyrically cutting, it was a grand ending to a night that celebrated all that Saves the Day has to offer.
