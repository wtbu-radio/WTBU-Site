<p><em>By Allie Antonevich</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a little under 3 weeks, 135,000 people will gather at Parc Jean-Drapeau on Montreal’s Saint Helen’s Island for the 14th annual OSHEAGA Music and Arts Festival. The popular Canadian event spans across three days from August 2-4, combining rising musical acts with visual installations and interactive activities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OSHEAGA’s coordinators see the event as an opportunity to merge “the discovery of local and national emerging talent, offering them the opportunity to play alongside some of the biggest international artists in the business,” and provides lineups over the three days for attendees to take advantage all that the festival has to offer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The celebration devotes most of its focus and energy to the creation of a diverse lineup. The headliner list boasts popular artists such as Flume, J Balvin, Janelle Monae, Logic, Tame Impala, Hozier, and Kaytranada. Straying from the current spotlight, it also includes rising stars that are certainly ones to watch. Artists to keep an eye on include Tierra Whack, Boy Pablo, Rejjie Snow, Ryan Beatty, Yellow Days, and SALES. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The festival doesn’t quite end with the music, either, as OSHEAGA also brings in a variety of food trucks and restaurants from the greater Montreal area to share the tasty treats locals love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Founded in 2006 by Nick Farkas, OSHEAGA’s main objective was to unite attendees from niche music circles with the broader public, and get people to flock from all over to experience all that Montreal has to offer. As the numbers increase every year, it is clear the OSHEAGA’s original foundation remains embedded in its current success. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The event is presented by Bell Alt TV in collaboration with Coors Light. It is proudly produced by evenko.</span></p>
