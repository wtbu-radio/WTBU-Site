_Interview by Nina Miller _

**DAN PORTNOF **

Marblehead, MA

CAS- Philosophy (class of 2020)

Left of the Dial (Mondays 4-6pm)

**How did you hear about WTBU radio?**

I just knew that BU had a radio station and I looked at splash and got involved last year interning on Casual Vibes

**What’s your favorite part of WTBU?**

The fact that I can impose my musical opinions and choices on the unassuming listeners

**What on your thoughts in the new studio?**

It’s so amazing!I love the surround sound and weird panels that I don’t know what they do and the ergonomic table that’s just enormous!

**Who’s your favorite Co-DJ?**

I don’t have a favorite I can’t say, I love everyone!

**Has your music taste broadened from WTBU?**

Yes but in a narrow direction- I listen to more alternative rock here and because we do rotation for LOTD which is cool because it’s stuff we never played

Overall I’m still pretty rock oriented. I do really like Kendrick Lamar now though

**What are your plans for WTBU radio next semester?**

Hoping to be on another show ideally to be on two shows just cause I like being here.

**What are you listening to right now?  **

Right now I’m listening to the Talking Heads

**Who is your biggest inspiration with music? Who was the first artist that made you realize music was something you love?**

I think the first band I really connected with was probably either the Who or the Clash

I listened to both of them like endlessly when I was young and they really got me into music I think.

Then probably Led Zeppelin and the Beatles were after and it all kind of evolved from there

**This is completely off topic, but when is the infamous Dan-Man-Bun coming back!!??**

The man bun hopefully can come back in the next week or so. Depends on if my hair is still long enough to tie it back before I get it cut again lolol.
