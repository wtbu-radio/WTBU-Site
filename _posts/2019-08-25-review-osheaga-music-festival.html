<p><em>By Allie Antonevich</em></p>

<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">From August 2-4, more than 130,000 festival goers flocked to Montreal, Quebec, for the 14th edition of </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Osheaga</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">. Founded in 2006, the popular Canadian event took place at the newly renovated site at </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Espace</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> 67 of </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Parc</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> Jean-</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Drapeau</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">, a beautiful island that holds the Montreal skyline in view.</span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Osheaga</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> welcomed rising and popular artists alike, positioning them on six different stages throughout the park. The festival isn’t confined to one genre of music. In fact, it welcomes the blend of talent from artists around the world. Performances started at 1pm each day with festival-goers trickling in, and by mid-day, the park was nearly full. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">On Friday, August 2, </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Joji</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> corralled sad e-boys and e-girls to dip into his newer releases. Flume delivered a convoluted, theatrical performance but brought in impressive features that held it together. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">On Sunday, Tierra Whack, a Philly rapper commanding the 2018 Freshman XXL class, elevated the meaning behind a rap performance. Whack, who donned colorful clothing and a commanding personality, found an impressive balance of entertainment and engagement. She brought an electric energy that had the entire audience jumping as she danced through most of </span></span><span class="s3"><span class="bumpedFont15">Whack World</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">, her 2018 EP.</span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Other impressive performances included King Princess (who successfully poked fun at the straight white men at the front of the stage, later laughing and saying, “but hey, you support the queers so…”), </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Kaytranada</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> (who successfully enveloped an enormous crowd with a thudding bassline), Tame Impala (who led a psychedelic performance and concluded with Same </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Ol</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">’ Mistakes, a crowd favorite). </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Osheaga</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> also featured rising star Mallrat, Yellow Days, </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Rejjie</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> Snow, and </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">ScHoolboy</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"> Q. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15"></span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">The festival encouraged relaxation as well, placing many hammocks and water stations around the venue. They had phone charging stations, tents equipped with information about substance use, and plenty of food from various Montreal eateries. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">Osheaga</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">, well organized and proudly produced by </span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">evenko</span></span><span class="s2"><span class="bumpedFont15">, returns to Montreal July 29-August 2, 2020. </span></span></p>
