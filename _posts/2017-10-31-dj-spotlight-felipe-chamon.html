<p><b>COM-Film/TV (18’)</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your favorite WTBU memory?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we read listener submissions for embarrassing stories on The Blunder Years and one story was so shocking that DJ Anjali had to lie on the floor for a few minutes because she couldn't understand why this happened to the poor soul.</span></p>
<p><b>What have you gained from being in WTBU?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A best friend. One of my DJs from last semester on The Blunder Years has become one of my best friends. I am so thankful for WTBU giving this to me. Also, I have gained lots of knowledge of how to create content for my show and how to use the studio.</span></p>
<p><b>What inspired you to create your radio show?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed my experiences with The Blunder Years, and wanted to continue working with WTBU. I had this idea for a show about getting to know different people, and pitched it to WTBU and they liked it.</span></p>
<p><b>What is your biggest piece of BU advice to people?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get involved. Try new clubs and new activities. Meet people.</span></p>
