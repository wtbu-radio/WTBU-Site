**1\. Japanese Breakfast -** **_Soft Sounds from Another Planet_**

Blending dream pop, science fiction, and intimate stories from her life, Michelle Zauner’s second album as Japanese Breakfast creates a warm atmosphere featuring a killer saxophone solo, a robot-human love story, and plenty of groovy bass lines.

Perfect for: solitary night rides on the T, stargazing

**2\. LCD Soundsystem -** **_American Dream_**

Though LCD Soundsystem’s decision to un-retire from music rubbed some the wrong way, _American Dream_ is decidedly a triumphant return. Doing all things LCD does best, James Murphy makws existential angst danceable while trying out some new musical directions.

Perfect for: seeing live at Agganis Arena, staring at your laptop for far too long

**3\. (Sandy) Alex G -** **_Rocket_**

_Rocket_ features country folk tracks, darker experimental ones, and everything in between. On this album, Alex G blends styles to create an intriguing new indie rock record.

Perfect for: watching the leaves fall on Bay State road in an 8 a.m.-running-to-class haze

**4\. Perfume Genius -** **_No Shape_**

I’m ashamed to say that I only started listening to this album in December, but it quickly became one of my favorites of the entire year. With lyrics regarding his struggles with chronic illness, gender, love, autoerotic asphyxiation, and supernatural forces within his home, Mike Hadreas presents a slick album that empowers while embracing softness.

Perfect for: hyping yourself before an exam

**5\. King Krule -** **_The Ooz_**

King Krule’s latest album embraces the dark dinge of the city and creates a unified, edgy sound. The 19 diverse tracks include spoken word poetry, jazz, hints of punk, and of course, Archy Marshall’s signature snarl.

Perfect for: dreary, angry walks down Comm Ave on rainy days

**  6. Florist -** **_If Blue Could be Happiness_**

A self-described “friendship project,” Florist embraces the beauty of nature–beams of light, the lightness of the air, mountains and creeks and autumn afternoons–but also deals with painful growth, nostalgia and healing. The album is minimal, yet packed with sensitive lyrics, gentle drums, and sparkling acoustic guitar.

Perfect for: sunny cool mornings along the Charles, running through grassy parks

**7\. Alvvays -** **_Antisocialites_**

After three years, Alvvays returned with a bubbly dream pop record that cleaned up and elevated the sound of 2014’s self-titled album. Driven by lead singer Molly Rankin’s smooth vocals, the album addresses a failing relationship with evocative lyrics and clear, bright guitar.

Perfect for: singing in the shower, caffeine highs

**8. Stef Chura -** **_Messes_**

My first introduction to Stef Chura was seeing her open for Jay Som at the Sinclair. Though we arrived after her set had already begun, I was dancing before we even could see the stage. Chura’s ‘90s rock influence was evident not only by her Heatmiser t-shirt, but by her fuzzy, jangly sound. From energetic tracks like “Spotted Gold” to slow, heavy-hitting ones like “Human Being,” the album is one of highs and lows, much like the messes of real life.

Perfect for: probably almost getting a noise complaint in your room

**9\. Remo Drive -** **_Greatest Hits_**

The soundtrack to my summer was Remo Drive’s first album. _Greatest Hits_ is a stellar midwest emo rock record that manages to stand out in a category that is often homogenous with shoutable lyrics and powerful riffs.

Perfect for: yelling outside between sets at a show

**10\. Dirty Projectors -** **_Dirty Projectors_**

Dirty Projectors self-titled is a highly personal breakup album highlighted by Dave Longstreth’s dynamic vocals and fidgety electronic elements. Partly drawing inspiration from early 2000s pop and R&B, Longstreth incorporates a multitude of sounds and styles while maintaining Dirty Projectors’ familiar eccentricity.

Perfect for: testing your vocal range, driving through someone else’s hometown
