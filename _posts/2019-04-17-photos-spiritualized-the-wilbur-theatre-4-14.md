Boston was graced with a two-hour performance from English space-rock band Spiritualized this Sunday 4/14 at The Wilbur Theatre. With no opening band, the multi-membered rock ensemble glided through a number of entrancing atmospheric pieces to more full-bodied danceable tunes during their set. Playing music from both their earlier records and their newest album release from 2018, "And Nothing Hurt," Spiritualized moved their audience with a powerful display of musical expertise and sentimental emotion.
