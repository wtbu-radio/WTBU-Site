SASAMI (Sasami Ashworth) will headline at Brighton Music Hall this Saturday, April 27, with support from Sen Morimoto. She is currently touring her self-titled debut album that was released on March 8. Previously, singles “[Callous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2eGnkiy26g)” and “[Not the Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T61l0Qlo-1E)” were released in 2018 and “[Jealousy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo5SBdEbEHs)” was released in early 2019. Ashworth describes _SASAMI_’s lyrics as “a mix of a diary and a collection of letters, written but never sent, to people I've been intimately involved with in one way or another.” Even though _SASAMI_ is Ashworth’s first solo album, the Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter, producer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist has been making music for years, from studying French horn classically to playing synths for rock band Cherry Glazerr from 2015 to 2018.
