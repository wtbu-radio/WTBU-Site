Jimi Hendrix, a name that needs no introduction, has long been considered one of the most historic electric guitar players of the rock ‘n’ roll movement. So it is not at all surprising that _Both Sides of the Sky,_ the album released on March 9, is a trans-centennial echo of his iconic solo skills. The album includes 13 studio recordings from the years between 1968 and 1970 before his death, 10 of which are never before released.

“Mannish Boy” opens with a guitar riff on top of a cymbal track, then dives into a catchy funk tune that is sustained throughout the song. In general, I prefer the original _Blues_ recording, but this iconic song is the right album opener as it perfectly segways into the next song–a different version of “Lover Man,” which has its fast-paced, fun-sized solo injected right in the middle. This recording is a good rival to the _Valleys of Neptune_ version, and I think it’s one of the wins for the album.

“Hear My Train a Comin’” slows the pace down a bit, allowing the electric riffs at the beginning to be prolonged. It’s reminiscent of the original _Jimi Hendrix Experience._ This gives the song a soulful twist in comparison to the two funkier tracks previous to it. “Stepping Stone,” the unreleased version, is a harsh departure from soul style, with a rushed pace in which the guitar tune mimics the lyrics. However, the end of the song invites an epic guitar solo that can’t be overlooked.

I could see “$20 Fine” becoming one of the more overshadowed songs of the album, seeing as that it is put between “Stepping Stone” and “Power of Soul.” “Power of Soul” is exactly what the name suggests; the overpowering electric guitar drives the track, which is what Jimi is best at. Then comes “Jungle,” perfect for those Hendrix fans who love to listen to a slow, soulful instrumental without a lyric-heavy track overlapping the tune.

“Things I Used to Do” is a refreshing, southern blues take for the collection, with an proportionate reliance on vocals and guitar, and has a pleasing southern drawl on the main guitar solo. The recording of “Georgia Blues,” love it or hate it, was absolutely necessary for this album.

Now we really get into the leisurely, almost sedated portion of the album. “Sweet Angel” is relatively similar to the originally released recording, but it’s instrumental and has a fresher sound. This allows you to really hear the guitar work behind the lyrics from _The Jimi Hendrix Experience_ recording. “Woodstock” features Stephen Stills with Hendrix on bass and it is just the right tempo to ramp up to the conclusion of the album.

“Send My Love to Linda” would be my least favorite on the album, just because I don’t think it was absolutely necessary. However, when I listen back to that classic Jimi solo in the last minute and a half, I question that stance. Then, finally comes “Cherokee Mist.” This song has a much more warped, slow start than its original release, but it has all of the classic Hendrix sound distortions and twists that allow it to really bring the album home.
