<p><span>The Great Depression</span><span> will be hitting Boston on February 10th, 2019 when the Brighton, UK based pop-punk band, As It Is, plays at the Middle East (downstairs).  The tour follows the release of their album of the same name on August 10th, 2018.</span></p>
<p><span>As It Is formed in 2012 and signed to Fearless Records in 2014. Their first full-length album, “Never Happy, Ever After,” followed quickly behind in 2015.  Their sophomore album,   “okay.,” came in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span>Inspired by the sounds of bands like Taking Back Sunday and The Wonder Years, As It Is’ most recent release has been described as “emo and post-hardcore.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The Great Depression” tackles the issue of mental health and matters that are associated with it; this album is less pop-punk, as it reveals a more grim, brooding side of the band.  Check out the video for the lead single, </span><span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v%253DQJLw9z7-VGg%2523%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1547654447394000&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547654447411000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9LRvk3P-rmvHW6b3D1TnC_0G-xw">The Wounded World</a></span><span>.</span></p>
