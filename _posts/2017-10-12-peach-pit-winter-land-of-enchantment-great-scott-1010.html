<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peach Pit is four totally normal guys playing abnormally good surf rock music. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">played at Great Scott in Allston, one of the tiniest venues I’ve ever attended, on Monday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oct. 9.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Scott bar television played The Hobbit while a friend and I sat through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">soundcheck for the hard-rocking girlband main act, Winter. Before doors opened, the four </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver-native Peach Pit members warmly introduced themselves. It made for a very relaxed pre-show environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peach Pit play in very specific costumes: guitarist Chris Vanderkooy in a burnt orange turtleneck; Mikey Pascuzzi in a blue denim hat on the drums; bassist Pete Wilton in a loose pair of dusty overalls; and lead singer Neil Smith wearing a purple sweater over a complementary orange polo, completing the look with khakis. They have long hair and significant facial hair: a combination of young adults who appreciate vintage style and your weird relatives, nostalgic for their one favorite clothing item from decades past. It’s the same look in all of their recent promotional photos, and Neil can be found dancing his heart out in the same garb in their somewhat YouTube-viral “Seventeen” music video. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Peach Pit was only the second opener for The Land of Enchantment, it seemed that most of the crowd was there to see them. Their sound is friendly, with plentiful guitar and head-nodding (or full-body-dancing) rhythms. Smith’s voice is so satisfying. They played with cohesive dancing, passing around a fan’s heart-shaped sunglasses that blended perfectly into their style. The show’s setlist was made up almost entirely of songs off their new album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being so Normal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Personal favorites of mine include “Techno Show,” dedicated to a Swedish friend’s adoration for techno music, and “Chagu’s Sideturn,” which was prefaced with an anecdote about smoking hard drugs with a strange man named Chagu in a foreign country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This band is recognizable for a strange relationship with their fans. They refer to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">themselves and their fans as “daddies,” aligned with pop culture’s “sugar daddy”-“sugar baby” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationships. However, as they attended to their merch table post-performance, they showed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional reception to fan photos, signatures, compliments, and conversations. These guys </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really care for their fans, which has absolutely contributed to their growing fanbase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I had discovered Peach Pit’s first EP, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweet FA</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just this past summer, it was a real </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">treat seeing these guys perform. Actual peach pits may be filled with enough arsenic to kill a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">human being, but this quartet is nothing but sweet.</span></p>
