Montreal’s [She-Devils](https://www.shedevilsinc.com/2nd-home) are making their way through Boston this Friday to tour their first full-length album released last month. The s/t album features sonically intense, but somehow mellow, indie pop tunes. “Darling” embraces that duality, while tracks like “Hey Boy” have a light airy summery feel, despite the fact that they were born on the streets of Montreal. The sound is innovative, taking classic acts like Iggy Pop and Madonna and viewing them through a kaleidoscope, and then turning them into an entirely new, equally as stunning piece of art.

_She-Devils_ has a cosmic, spacey sound while still being inviting and familiar—truly and uniquely charming. The dreamy fusion can be experienced firsthand at the Lilypad Inman on June 9. She-Devils will be supported by local bands Mini Dresses and Beautiful Woman. The all-ages show is at 10 p.m., and tickets are available at the door for $10.
