<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 12th, the Boston-founded band, Juice, returned and performed a remarkable show at Brighton Music Hall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opener for the show was Paper Citizen, an indie artist who also had their start in Boston. The Boston pride concert was the perfect show to start off the Marathon Monday weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the smaller venue, Paper Citizen’s impactful voice made it seem as if the show was taking place at TD Garden. Her set didn’t need flashy clothes (she wore all white) or any reason to hype the crowd up because her stage presence, talent and guitar shredding skills was more than enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was the first reminder of the night that Boston builds talented artists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars of the concert were the seven-man, self described “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rock, r&amp;b and hip-hop” band, Juice. They left their first mark on Boston when they won Battle of the Bands in 2014 at Boston College and from then on, they never ceased making Boston proud. Their show on April 12th was another one of those marks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 10:30PM on the dot, the crowd, which was made up of older college students and graduates, began chanting “Juice.” The ensemble walked out soon with their designated instruments. There were two guitars, a bass, drums and the coolest violin you will ever see. The talent on the stage was overwhelming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Stevens, lead singer, said to the crowd, “What’s up Boston?” and the crowd roared back in excitement. Their excitement set the tone and expectations for the night and Juice delivered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first song, “Where I Wanna Be,” immediately got the crowd engaged in a sea of “Oooh oooh yeah”s, which feels like a song destined for the top charts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the band was performing, patrons of the crowd were waving to the artists like they were old friends — they probably were, because of the band having their start at BC. Throughout the show, crowd members were hugging each other in reunion because they “haven’t seen each other in so long.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The happiness from reuniting with one another and seeing their old friends perform on stage was contagious to the rest of the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good vibes continued with the song “Dave (Turn The Music Down)” which was filled with political and pop culture references and a catchy hook. Juice demonstrated that they are more than just another boy band but artists with true talent and depth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juice’s range of genres in their set list made the show great for lovers of all genres, just specific ones or who were looking to branch out. There was rock, pop, guitar and violin solos, rap verses and beautiful melodies from Stevens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show couldn’t be what it was without the other members which include </span>Rami El-Abidin<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on bass, </span>Daniel Moss<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on guitar, </span>Miles Clyatt<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on drums, </span>Christian Rose<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on violin and vocals, </span>Michael Ricciardulli<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on guitar, </span>Kamau Burton<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on acoustic guitar and vocals, and </span>Ben Stevens<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on vocals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of the set, Burton, Rose and Stevens took a break from singing and Stevens addressed the crowd again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re Juice and we’re from Boston, Massachusetts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many bands who make it big forget where they came from but for Juice, it was a badge they wore on their shoulder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juice has been on tour for a while and have shows all across America starting from June 7th to August 17th. It would be a major loss to miss out on seeing them this summer. </span></p>
