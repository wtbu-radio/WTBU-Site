On May 9, Jorja Smith, accompanied by Ama Lou, performed at Brighton Music Hall. 

Hailing from London, Ama Lou opened up for Jorja Smith, setting up the night for soulful, authentic, R&B that we would also see form Jorja. Her tiny frame somehow holds a deep, raspy voice that, when paired with powerful beats, creates an overall feeling of nostalgia and hurt. Watching her, listeners could tell that she was giving nothing but her best. 

During her set, she slowed it down and played a song she wrote when she was 14 years old on her guitar. This was an intimate moment, shifting the energy in the room from a previously “party” one, to a more vulnerable, delicate one. It gave a personal look at Ama Lou, and was a great way to close out her set. 

After her, Jorja Smith, another 20-year-old artist originating from England, took the stage. Her band set up first, and during this time her drummer lit incense, setting the vibe right off the bat. Walking on stage, she immediately dove into “Something in the Way” off her EP _Project 11_ released in 2016_._ The song features a looped recording of her vocals, seeming to originate from her background in classical music. 

Everything about her was effortless, seeming at home in the spotlight. She just waltzed on stage, barely opening her mouth to release a voice that seemed almost authoritative–demanding attention, but that also somehow retained fragility and vulnerability–singing the words “_Even the sun doesn’t seem to last_” repeatedly, leaving the crowd stunned. Without skipping a beat, her and her band transitioned into “Where Did I Go?” a single also released in 2016. After this mellow song about letting go, Smith addressed the audience, thanking them for having her back in Boston. 

With slight smile, and a little giggle she didn’t waste too much time before beginning her next song “Teenage Fantasy.” The song highlighted the intensity of falling in love and being heartbroken as a teenager–relatable to the crowd that was composed of what looked like mostly college kids. 

She played through “February 3rd,” “Tomorrow,” “Goodbyes,” “Lifeboats,” and “Don’t Watch Me Cry”–all songs from her upcoming debut album, _Lost & Found_, which will be released on June 8. The commonality between all of the new tunes was the honesty that each of them radiated. Despite the crowd not knowing the words, her voice kept everyone engaged. The performance was anything but boring. “Don’t Watch Me Cry” took place during the encore where it seemed as if the audience was holding their breath over her vocals, erupting into applause during the last chorus. Jorja Smith is the epitome of sincerity. 

To close out the night she ended with “On My Mind,” her biggest single to date. The song, upbeat and easily danced to, led to laughter throughout the venue. The most playful we had seen her all night, Jorja broke into a few seconds of dance before finishing the song. After thanking her band and the audience multiple times, she left, leaving only the wonderfully curated energy by her and her band to resonate with the rest of the room.
