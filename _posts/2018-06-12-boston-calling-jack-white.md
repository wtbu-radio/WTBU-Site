Jack White used to be a minimalist. His two-person band, the White Stripes, blasted to alt-rock stardom in the 2000s, winning Grammys and producing the banger-turned-stadium-chant “Seven Nation Army.” Every kid who’s picked up a bass since knows how to pluck out that famous riff.

But White Stripes Jack White is not the Jack White who headlined Boston Calling on Saturday night. Present-day, solo career Jack White has lost the simplicity that made him famous. He brought his new bloated style and lots of baggage.

White isn’t the zeitgeistiest choice to headline a music festival, as [WBUR’s Amelia Mason notes](http://www.wbur.org/artery/2018/05/24/who-is-boston-calling-for). His latest album, _Boarding House Reach,_ isn’t a musical game-changer or a culture shifter–it’s a mess. That said, he’s part of a larger set of headliners (The Killers, Paramore, Eminem) that shows some serious nostalgia for the 2000s.

White was happy to indulge that nostalgia, zig-zagging between his more recent solo work and favorites from his White Stripes days. With five band members instead of two, the audience heard fresh, fleshed-out versions of those songs, and the change was fun. “Hardest Button to Button” became a heavy metal, punch-you-in-the-face wall of sound. “Hotel Yorba” got countrified, with White joining the keyboard player on an upright piano for a quadruple-hand honky-tonk jam.

But no amount of good White Stripes songs could cancel out how bad some of the tracks off _Boarding House Reach_ are. Not even the energy of a live show could save them. “Connected By Love” featured a space-age vocal filter, a cheesy Hammond organ and a canned gospel choir repeating “_We’re connected_” as White preachified, one melodramatic hand shaking at his throat. The level of distortion on his voice on that track and others goes beyond the White Stripes’ low-quality-on-purpose sound. The crunchy, wobbly filters White uses distract from the songs and are genuinely annoying.

After that song came an anticlimactic intermission. The band walked off at 10:13, but the festival schedule said White would be playing until 10:50. There were a few cheers for an encore until the audience realized White would come back on regardless. He did, after four minutes of non-suspense.

Afterwards, White became the oblivious uncle that shakes his head at the youth of today. In “Ball and Biscuit,” he substituted the original lyrics to either make himself sound hip or mock young people. “_Now read it in the newspaper/Ask your friends to see if_ they’re woke_,_” he sang. In the recorded version, it’s “_to see if_ they know_._” Just as corporations kill memes when they start using them in ads, White did his part to kill the word “woke.”

Artists can use their art to fight for their causes, but it should still be good art. White’s wasn’t. His lack of subtlety extends to his political statements, too. A video on the screens behind the band showed his drummer throwing a dart at a Trump face dartboard. He dug at the president again when he switched out a line in the set closer “Seven Nation Army” for the sentence “_I wanna build a wall_.”

These moves are especially strange considering he already has an excellent pro-immigrant, anti-Trump anthem. “_White Americans, what, nothing better to do?/Why don’t you kick yourself out, you’re an immigrant too_,” White sang in “Icky Thump,” all the way back in 2007. That song didn’t make it into Saturday’s show.
