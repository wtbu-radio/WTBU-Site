Vocalist-guitarist Jilian Medford has just released the sophomore album of her solo project, IAN SWEET, on Oct. 26. This new LP, _Crush Crusher_, navigates the intimate emotions of exploring identity and recognizing her place within relationships. She communicates these ideas in musings and declarations with her almost-raspy soprano voice backed by classic indie rock guitar tones and steady percussion. _Crush Crusher_ is a step forward for Medford creatively and professionally as it shows a departure from her more lo-fi first album, _Shapeshifter,_ to a more cleanly produced sound allowing for each element of her songs to be identifiable and pungent for the listener. IAN SWEET arrives in Boston this Saturday, Nov. 3 as a part of her North American tour for _Crush Crusher._ The band originated in the Boston-based DIY scene, so this will be a special show for Medford, returning to her roots.

The show will be opened by Young Jesus and Sean Henry who are both accompanying her on the _Crush Crusher_ tour. Young Jesus is an LA-based four-piece that finds their niche in emotional indie rock embellished with experimental polyrhythms and shouted philosophical observations. They also have just released an album this month, _The Whole Thing Is Just There_. Next is Sean Henry, who focuses on grappling with sad, existential topics through jangly guitar sounds and simplistic lyrics reminiscent of early (Sandy) Alex G.
