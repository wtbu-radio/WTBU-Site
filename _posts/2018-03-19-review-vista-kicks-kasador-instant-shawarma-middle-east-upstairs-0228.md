After the release of their debut album _Booty Shakers Ball_, California-based rockers Vista Kicks set off on their first headline tour making stops across the U.S. including the Middle East Upstairs in Cambridge. Opening the night was Boston natives Instant Shawarma. They had a garage rock sound that did not stand out. The crowd seemed a bit disinterested as they had a long wait for the main act. The stage was so dark I could hardly see the band from the front row. The band announced that they would be coming back to play the Foundation Room at the House of Blues.

After about half an hour and a short set change, Canadian indie rock band Kasador hit the stage. The crowd was immediately intrigued as lead singer Will Hunter wowed the crowd with strong vocals and constant motion. Everyone began dancing within the first few notes and continued throughout their set. The band is still new to the music scene with only one EP, _Kasador_, out right now and a few singles. The crowd smiled and cheered at the end of their set and the band looked at the audience with pure gratitude.

The venue had finally filled out and everyone was excited for Vista Kicks. We could see some of the members changing by the side of the stage into their costumes. They wear the red velvet suits that can be seen on their album cover to every show on the tour. They walked onto the stage and the crowd began cheering. Immediately the band went into playing their new songs since they haven’t played them too many times yet. “Gimme Love” and “Work for Me” were the first two songs of the night. They sounded just like the album with a bit more passion that can only be heard during live sets. Before playing “Moving Forward,” the band began to poke fun at playing in Boston when lead singer Derek Thomas had the crowd repeat the phrase “Lobster Roll.” Bassist Trevor Sutton asked if anyone was named Alice as a segue to their song with the same name, but unfortunately no one was.

A bit further into their set it was time for fan favorite “Love & Paranoia,” so Thomas asked the crowd if anyone has ever been in love. The audience erupted as a clear sign that they have and the band started singing. They decided to perform a new song called, “Twenty Something Nightmare” that will be featured on their sophomore album of the same name. They announced the album will be out during the summer. The song sounded like their usual sound, but with a slight twist.

During “Gotta Get Away,” Thomas asked the crowd to form an open circle and invited anyone who wanted to dance to step inside. The crowd listened and a huge dance party formed with Thomas. The dance party lasted for a few minutes–many people decided to take part. Thomas eventually went back onstage to finish their set.

Near the end, drummer Nolan Le Vine had a drum solo that Thomas decided to live stream for fans not at the show. The band finished with their biggest hit to date “Marceline” and everyone continued to dance.

An intense energy could be felt throughout their performance, and with each song it grew. The audience and the band never stopped moving. Vista Kicks will be back soon, but no dates have been announced yet.
