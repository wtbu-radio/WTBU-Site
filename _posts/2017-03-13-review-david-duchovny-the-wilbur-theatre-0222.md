On Wednesday night, Feb. 22, The Wilbur Theater was lit up with groups of people ready to see a music performance from actor/writer/musician David Duchovny and his band.  Currently on their sophomore U.S tour, the band was on their sixth stop out of eleven, all in promotion of Duchovny’s 2015 debut album _Hell or Highwater_ as well as his upcoming album, whose title is TBA.

Though Duchovny is well-known for his acting in the television shows The X-Files, Californication and more, he began to write his own songs a few years ago and then became serious about putting out an album around 2014.  With all music written by himself, he worked with producer Colin Lee and president of Boston label ThinkSay Records Brad Davidson to create the album.  The singer/songwriter is joined by Berklee College of Music alumnus of the band Weather as his backing band for the album and all performances.  Together, they create an alternative rock sound.  In previous interviews, Duchovny has cited influences on his music such as Leonard Cohen, R.E.M. and Wilco, and it clearly comes across in his music.  His songs are masterfully crafted, with lyrics that showcase Duchovny’s penchant for writing, as they sound like they could be pieces of poetry.

Performance-wise, the group put on a great show that was fun and energizing.  Backing band member Pat McCusker (guitarist), opened for Duchovny with some of his own material and invited some of the other band members (including producer Colin Lee) out on stage at times to perform with him.  He warmed up the crowd with both his acoustic and electric guitar on songs, which were enriched by his impressive vocal chops.  His own material was well done and had a unique sound to it. At one point he jokingly made the comment that all his songs were “soft and sad.”  Accompanied by his guitar, he finished with a song that he harmonized on with other band members, adding for a final first glimpse into their impressive talent.

After a break between sets, the lights lowered and the crowd became energized with the promise of more music.  Over the loudspeakers, the iconic guitar opening to David Bowie’s classic hit “Rebel Rebel” blazed out, pumping up the crowd even more as the band came back on stage to their respective spots, followed by the man of the night, David Duchovny.  Of course the crowd was going crazy at this point, as many fans of all of Duchovny’s work were in attendance.

But the crowd was not the only energized entity in the theater—Duchovny and his band were also electrified.  They performed their songs with a zeal and playfulness, showcasing the songs off of _Hell or Highwater_, such as “3000,” “Positively Madison Avenue” and “Let it Rain.”   They also played some new songs from the upcoming album.  Between numbers, Duchovny would talk and interact with the crowd, sometimes giving a little anecdote about his songs, which he did for one of the aforementioned new songs off his upcoming album.  It’s based off of the singer’s visit to the famous church in Paris, Sacré-Coeur and how he learned that there are always people there praying for others all around the world, even those that they do not know.  Other stories included similar touching qualities and funny moments too, such as the singer saying that, because he was in Boston, he should be pronouncing his song “Stars” as ‘Stahs.’  He also included a few covers in his set, such as Lou Reed’s “Sweet Jane” and The Band’s “The Weight.”

While the music was all good, what really made the night was how interactive the performers were with the audience and how much energy they brought.  As previously mentioned, Duchovny interacted through anecdotal storytelling or joking with the audience, but he also really went for it.  At one point he got_ off_ the stage and came into the crowd, dancing with audience members and running through the aisles high-fiving people.  He also danced on stage, truly getting into it along with everyone else.  Everyone was having a good time, but the verve David Duchovny and his band brought to their performance made everyone have a _great_ time.

At the end, they came out to do a few songs as an encore, and for the very last one, Duchovny leaned into the mic and said, “You know where my heart is at.” Then he and his band members pulled out of their pockets their own individual pussy hats and put them on for the finale, which was a cover of the classic Sly and the Family Stone song “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).”  At this point, everyone was singing and dancing along.  Truly, how could you not?  They put on a fantastic show, and the closing was a great way to end the night.  Hopefully, David Duchovny will be back again soon.
