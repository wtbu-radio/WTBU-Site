<p><em>By Monica Sucic</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really never thought that I’d get close to a band that called me “Monica Tree” the first time we met, but I’ve been talking with California pop-rockers Sure Sure for a bit more than a year now. The energetic quartet played at Brighton Music Hall on Oct. 23 as a part of their “first ever third tour.” The group is made up of my “four unofficial uncles,” also known as guitarist Charlie Glick, bassist Michael Coleman, drummer Kevin Farzad, and “keysman” Chris Beachy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure Sure has been tearing their way across the United States throughout 2018. They kicked off the year by opening for Hippo Campus in January and February, then they showcased their feel-good energy on their first headlining tour in the spring. Through the summer, the four friends moved out of their banana-yellow house and studio and made sure to get to recording right away in their new place. Their fall plans have been consumed with their headlining tour with Wilderado which took them coast to coast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first opener of the night was Boston’s own Tipling Rock. After opening for Sure Sure at the Middle East in April, the gang of surf pop rockers showed both old and new fans that they’ve still got spunk. They played classics like “Campus Fashion,” “Low Tide Love,” and “A Side / B Side.” The four Bostonians also jammed out their single “Prima Donna” which was released this past summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilderado, the second opener, provided some slow and heavy folk-rock. The about page on their website simply states “four dudes,” but they were much more. They gave a powerful and entertaining set and seemed to sway many of Sure Sure’s surf rock fans to jump a bit on the folk side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure Sure took the stage to a bounty of cheers. As per tradition, Glick removed his shoes upon reaching his spot on stage to the right of Beachy. He then took the mic to quickly announce that the band would be giving out a medal to whoever danced the hardest and he warned that the whole band would be watching. The fans were mostly college students who discovered Sure Sure through their winter tour with Hippo Campus, but some people in the crowd were Tipling Rock fans that had grown to love the band from their last headlining tour. Regardless of how old or new the fans were, they all began jumping and dancing around to the opening song, “Giants.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tour exposed the crowd to some new tunes including singles “Lie Lie Lie” and “Idiot.” These two new singles stay true to their trademark sound, but they have a more sophisticated feel in both lyrics and production. Sure Sure also played some of their older songs like “New Biome.” They slashed out their usual hits like “Friends” from the self-titled album and “The Girls” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Songs from 2014. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Girls” is a treat to see in person, especially since it’s one of the few songs from the EP that the group plays live. It’s brought to life in an energizing way as the electric guitar fills the air and the drums snap through the static, and the band also snaps at the crowd during the bridge. When everything breaks after the bridge, the crowd goes wild and everyone feels like family even if they’ve never heard Sure Sure’s music before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most unique parts of the show is when Glick introduces “Hands Up Head Down,” where he instructs the audience to put their hands up and heads down in a zombie-like fashion when the chorus plays. Although it may seem weird, there’s never been a crowd that hasn’t done the dance. On a cold October night, the spooky song really hit the spot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Sure Sure is a not only a great group of guys, but a unique and refreshing band on the pop rock scene. Their sound remains consistent and outstanding, but over the past few years I’ve had the pleasure of seeing their production and style grow stronger. They’ll be opening for Young the Giant at the beginning of 2019, and they’ll be hitting some huge venues such as Connecticut’s own Mohegan Sun, which is a quick bus ride away from Boston. Be sure to catch Sure Sure live as they coast above the norm and cut through all expectations.</span></p>
