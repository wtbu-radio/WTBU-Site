_By David Taylor_

White Denim’s new album _Performance_ has revived their unhinged rocker vibe, highlighting the band’s impressive musical ability while maintaining an unpolished, gritty sound heard in their earlier albums. There is a distinctly recognizable Austin, Texas hum to the band, sharing a similar experimentally psychedelic quality to the 13th Floor Elevators as well as incorporating clean blues licks similar to Gary Clark Jr. and Stevie Ray Vaughan. That’s not to say the band is unoriginal. White Denim have taken their Austin roots and transformed them into something new and entirely their own.

Taking their _Performance_ to the road, White Denim have began their international tour, playing in Boston as well as LA, Austin, Paris, Berlin, and London. The band will headline Brighton Music Hall on October 9, 2018. Combined with the intimate setting and White Denim’s reputation for live performances, the show promises to be an excellently energetic event.
