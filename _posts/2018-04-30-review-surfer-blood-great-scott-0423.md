Indie rock act Surfer Blood performed at the Great Scott in Allston, Mass. on April 23 following the 2017 releases of their fourth studio album _Snowdonia_ and their _Covers_ project.

The band’s two original members, John Paul Pitts and Tyler Schwarts, hail from West Palm Beach, Florida. They grew up in a tight-knit music scene where Pitt’s band would put on shows in attics and restaurants. Pitts cites hearing Dinosaur Jr.’s _You’re Living All Over Me_ for the first time when he was 14 as a direct inspiration for his music.

The opening band, Winter, was a satisfying dose of ethereal vocals, swirling guitars, and tight baselines. The reverb of the guitars would flawlessly transition from airy and delicate to completely drenched.

When Surfer Blood took the stage, they opened with “Floating Vibes.”This song accentuates the band’s ability to write a simple, yet infectious earworm. The instantly recognizable riff opens their debut album, _Astro Coast_. Fans of the band who listen to that album front to back feel immediately comfy and nostalgic as their live experience with Surfer Blood opens up with the same song their album experience does.

While it is common for lyrics to get drowned in the sound at live shows, Pitts’s vocals were clear as a bell. Even someone who never heard Surfer Blood music would be able to discern what he was saying. Pitts had a natural sense of vocal dynamic and would hold his head further away from the microphone while delivering the screamed lyrics on “Weird Shapes.” This allowed his voice to echo throughout the room and recreated the sound of the studio recording.

Pitts had great chemistry with the new band members, guitarist Mike McCleary and bassist Lindsey Mills. Throughout songs, Pitts and McCleary would each take turns delivering solos that catered to their personal musical idiosyncrasies. While their styles of guitar playing were different on their own, they would blend perfectly when played simultaneously. Whether they chugged out hard hitting riffs or impeccably picked intricate leads, the two always complemented each other.

Songs from the new album translated well in a live setting, especially “Six Flags in F or G,” a Snowdonia highlight .When performed live, the band had an intuitive sense of creating the tension the song requires. Every instrument stuck out on its own, with Pitts playing a hypnotic looping riff, until the midway point where everything came together and was lifted by bright guitar chords and Beach Boys-esque backing vocals. The backing vocals from the other band members gave way to more melodic ideas and added another layer of cohesion in the band’s sound.

A highlight of the night was when Pitts put down his guitar to join the crowd during the song “Take It Easy.” He didn’t just stay standing at the barricade; he roamed the room and danced individually with certain audience members. The Great Scott may not be a house venue, but moments like this create an atmosphere that make the room feel just as tiny. Pitts had a natural ability to make the room feel smaller than it was and would talk to the crowd often between sets as if we were all just hanging out together. He even asked if someone had a place they could crash for the night and to let him know after the show. I would have been more than happy to help them out if my dorm could fit four extra people.
