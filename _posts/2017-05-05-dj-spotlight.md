Zachary McCollum

Do You Know Who You Are (Fridays 8am-10am)

**What are you listening to right now?**

I’m listening to _Greatest Hits_ by Remo Drive, _DAMN._ by Kendrick Lamar, and _All-AmeriKKKan Bada$$_ by Joey Bada$$.

**Why did you decide to join WTBU?**

I’ve always wanted to do radio since I was little and ever since I found radio I wanted to be a DJ. Now I have a show and it’s sweet.

**What’s your favorite part about your own show?**

Playing music that inspired emo or is connected to it in any way.

**Why is your show called what it’s called?**

There is this great album from a band called Texas is the Reason and it was released in 1997. They’re from New York, and they’re amazing, and that album is perfect.

**What do you like to do outside of WTBU?**

Play drums with my band, Devon Goods. We have an EP coming out and it will be on Spotify so check it out.
