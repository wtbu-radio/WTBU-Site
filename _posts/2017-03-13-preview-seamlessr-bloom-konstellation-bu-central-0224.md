Feb. 24, be prepared for the bassy-est night BU has ever seen. The Boston University Music Network is proudly hosting Konstellation, Bloom and V Crow, and the bass wizard himself, SeamlessR, for a unique, once in a lifetime EDM concert. Whether you’re a seasoned raver, or just a curious concert goer, you’re guaranteed to have something special to experience at this show. The concert will begin with a DJ set by the one and only, fully space helmeted, Konstellation. Be expecting anything from heavy dubstep to groovy glitch hop from this guy. Next will be the soon-to-be legend, Bloom, featuring the amazing guitarist, V Crow. These two Berklee boys will be making bass babies on stage with their mix of live improvisation and funky, jazzy electronic performance. Headlining the show will be the EDM/sound design YouTube celebrity, SeamlessR, performing a fully live set with a massive rig that’s straight from an ‘80′s sci-fi movie. Show starts at 7 p.m. at BU Central.
