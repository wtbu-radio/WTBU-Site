<p><em>By Monica Sucic</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 21st, WTBU DJ Monica Sucic caught up with COIN at Rockland Trust Bank Pavilion. The Nashville quartet has grown an immense fanbase since the release of their self-titled album in 2015, and have spent the past few years on headlining tours in support of their sophomore album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Will You Know If You Never Try?. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, they are preparing for the release of their third album and are on tour supporting Young the Giant and Fitz and the Tantrums. Sucic spoke with lead singer Chase Lawrence, guitarist Joe Memmel, and drummer Ryan Winnen about their latest single, their time in South Korea, and their plans for the rest of the summer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monica Sucic:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How have the past two years on tour been? </span></p>
<p><b>Chase Lawrence:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They've been really good; I think the most tangible, fun ones have been the February shows. They were the biggest shows we've played and it felt like 'We're doing it! We're really doing it! Together!' We had a lot of time off and that was a total reset. If you had asked me that question two months ago, I might've told you that I was really tired. But I'm good now. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What was it like to go to Seoul, and are you excited to go to Japan next month?</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yeah! Seoul was great, Korea was our favorite show ever probably.</span></p>
<p><b>Joe Memmel:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We're going back and are very excited about it.</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We're going back the day before Osaka. Japan should be a great experience. I don't know what to expect, so I'm just excited to go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Which city do you wish you could headline next? </span></p>
<p><b>JM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Like it's the last day on this earth?</span></p>
<p><b>CL: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm very excited to play Seoul again, it was a great show. Again, I'm not going to put expectations on that show either because that one was so special; I'm not even going to try to touch it. Something about playing London, also, was a really special time and I look forward to playing there again. Every show is so special, it really is. There's never a show that's never fulfilling and rewarding, even these support shows. You never know, you really never know.</span></p>
<p><b>JM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If I were friends with the lovely men from NASA, I'd invite a hundred people up to Mars and we'd play a show there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What was the inspiration behind the latest single, "Crash My Car?"</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The day after we played Music Midtown in Atlanta [in 2017], we played for like 15,000 people and we heard thousands scream "Talk Too Much." I knew, the next day, we had to write a song louder than "Talk Too Much." I was so inspired. We went to the studio, literally the next morning, and "Crash My Car" came out in probably three hours. But we didn't have a story. There was a chorus, there was some lyrics... it didn't really say much. Then in October [2017], a girl came to a show in Oxford, Mississippi. After the show, she stuck around to tell me that she got in a very bad car accident on the way to the show in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her car was literally totaled -- completely totaled. She showed up, still. She drove her totaled car and made it to Oxford, Mississippi in the same day. I was like 'Why would you do that, that's so dangerous!' and she [said] 'I want to be here. More than I care about my car, more than I care about my possessions.' It all clicked. That's what this song means. It's not about what you have, it's who you're with. </span></p>
<p><b>JM, Ryan Winnen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [clapping]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the writing and producing process change for album three from album two, and how so? </span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Album two was like a patchwork quilt of producers. It was our friends, and we had a big part of making it, but</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of people had their hands in the process. It's not that different from album three in that regard; we have our friends helping out. When you write a song, you make a demo of it, and it's a worse sounding thing of the real thing. Working backwards, we noticed that our demos sounded more energetic and more emotional than our final recordings. So we set out to make an album of demos. Every time we wrote, every time we played a part, we played it for keeps. We weren't just making it to get the idea out. We realized that you can't replicate that excitement that you have on that first try when you go for it. It's basically a diary -- honestly a journal -- of what we did for the past two years from green rooms, to the bus, from a van. </span></p>
<p><b>JM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every city has a piece of a song.</span></p>
<p><b>RW:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if it's a little vocal or something that we recorded in the van, it's all scratchy but if you isolated it you could hear it.</span></p>
<p><b>JM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's emotion in every single song all around the world. </span></p>
<p><b>RW</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Little artifacts. </span></p>
<p><b>CL</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: From Korea, from everywhere. There's iPhone recordings, MacBook recordings, and we just didn't overthink it. Sometimes the stuff sounds a little wacky maybe, but we didn't want to mess with the emotion.</span></p>
<p><b>JM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It's awesome. </span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Too many times we compared it to other recordings where it didn't sound polished enough or something.</span></p>
<p><b>RW:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Right, which is unhealthy.</span></p>
<p><b>CL: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the emotion is there and the energy is there why would you question it? It's not about the quality. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that why you've been bringing up The Committee for Sound and Mind?</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, the Committee for Sound and Mind is our record label.</span></p>
<p><b>RW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You're looking at it, it's just us.</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It's a collective of our friends who are designers, photographers, and we're all building this record label.</span></p>
<p><b>MS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is it Nashville-based?</span></p>
<p><b>CL: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's nowhere, it's everywhere. </span></p>
<p><b>JM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mars! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you could collaborate with any artist, living or dead, who would it be and why? </span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I don't know if I have an answer for that. It wouldn't live up to whatever I want. I respect and admire so many people, but everybody's a person. </span></p>
<p><b>RW:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You don't even know if it would work, you know? You have your heroes but...</span></p>
<p><b>CL: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We've written with our heroes. Sometimes it's been great.</span></p>
<p><b>JM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: I would say Ric Ocasek. If the write went bad, I would honestly just chill with him.</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Honestly yeah, Ric Ocasek for the cars. I'll take that one. He's still alive. There's still a chance for that one. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could get a tattoo for any artist, song, or album, what would it be?</span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So much music has shaped me. So many fans have [COIN] tattoos and it's amazing that our music has been formative to these people, but so much music has been formative to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>RW:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I would get so many tattoos. </span></p>
<p><b>CL:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I'm just racing with lyrics and amazing stuff that's shaped me. There's this song by this band called The Antlers called "I Don't Want Love." I don't even know what it means, I just know that that song shaped me a ton. </span></p>
<p><b>JM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ask me in a year and I'll have a whole sleeve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COIN's latest single, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash My Car, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is out now and they will be returning to Northampton, MA on their headlining tour this fall. </span></p>
