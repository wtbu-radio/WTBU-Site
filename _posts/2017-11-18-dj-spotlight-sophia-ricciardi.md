Sophia Ricciardi

COM 2020

Film/TV

Why did you join WTBU?

When I first toured COM, one of the tour guides showed us the WTBU Studio and everyone there was super nice and welcoming and it just seemed like a really great group of people. And who doesn’t love to listen to music, so I figured I’d give it a shot since it seemed like a low time commitment. It ended up being a really fun thing to go do every week.

What’s your favorite part of being in WTBU?

I really just love everyone in WTBU. I’ve never met someone – whether they’re a DJ or E-Board member – who hasn’t been super welcoming and down to talk about music and life and just have a good time. Every show I’ve worked on we’ve all just been hanging out, vibing and it’s been so nice to be able to go somewhere with a bunch of people who are all just here to have a good time listening to music and make the station awesome.

What is it that makes your show unique?

As far as I know we are the only show that does movie scores and soundtracks, so that’s part of it. We really try to bring a genre of music that doesn’t get a lot of attention out of the woodwork which I think is super fun. I think more people should listen to movie scores and that might just be the film major in me talking. It’s like classical music but with more electric guitar. I think everybody could use more bad-assery in their life and what better way to do it then with college radio.

Can you describe your show with a single meme?

If throwing Nicholas Cage’s face into pictures is a meme, that is it. But we’ve recently been on a Shrek kick so who knows.

What artists have you been listening to lately?

I’ve been listening to Public Access T.V., they’re in the process of putting out their new album. I really liked_Never Enough_which was their debut. I think they’re a really cool kind-of punk, kind-of classic band coming out of New York that I’ve been keeping an eye on. Other than that, I’ve been listening to Mark Mothersbaugh, he did the_Thor_soundtrack which is fire, straight fire. It’s the perfect blend of electric and classic score trends and I love it!

How do you like the new studio?

I love it! I’m so excited to be able to play live music. I volunteered to help with the in-studio team so I’m super hyped to learn about all the new equipment. It’s just super awesome to be able to have a real space. I have a friend that goes to Penn State and is on the radio station there and I sent him a snapchat of our studio and he got super jealous.
