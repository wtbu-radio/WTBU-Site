<div><span></span><strong>DAN PORTNOF </strong></div>
<p>Marblehead, MA</p>
<p>CAS- Philosophy (class of 2020)</p>
<p>Left of the Dial (Mondays 4-6pm)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>How did you hear about WTBU radio?</strong></div>
<div><span>I just knew that BU had a radio station and I looked at splash and got involved last year interning on Casual Vibes</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>What’s your favorite part of WTBU?</strong></div>
<div><span>The fact that I can impose my musical opinions and choices on the unassuming listeners</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>What on your thoughts in the new studio?</strong></div>
<div><span>It’s so amazing!I love the surround sound and weird panels that I don’t know what they do and the ergonomic table that’s just enormous!</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Who’s your favorite Co-DJ?</strong></div>
<div><span>I don’t have a favorite I can’t say, I love everyone!</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Has your music taste broadened from WTBU?</strong></div>
<div><span>Yes but in a narrow direction- I listen to more alternative rock here and because we do rotation for LOTD which is cool because it’s stuff we never played</span></div>
<div><span>Overall I’m still pretty rock oriented. I do really like Kendrick Lamar now though</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><strong>What are your plans for WTBU radio next semester?</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Hoping to be on another show ideally to be on two shows just cause I like being here.</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>What are you listening to right now?  </strong></div>
<div><span>Right now I’m listening to the Talking Heads</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Who is your biggest inspiration with music? Who was the first artist that made you realize music was something you love?</strong></div>
<div><span>I think the first band I really connected with was probably either the Who or the Clash</span></div>
<div><span>I listened to both of them like endlessly when I was young and they really got me into music I think.</span></div>
<div><span>Then probably Led Zeppelin and the Beatles were after and it all kind of evolved from there</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>This is completely off topic, but when is the infamous Dan-Man-Bun coming back!!??</strong></div>
<div><span>The man bun hopefully can come back in the next week or so. Depends on if my hair is still long enough to tie it back before I get it cut again lolol.</span></div>
