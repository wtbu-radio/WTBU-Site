The wait for the _Waiting For You_ tour will finally be over when The Aces perform downstairs at the Middle East this Sunday, 3/3. From Provo, UT, The Aces are an indie pop rock band consisting of Cristal Ramirez, Alisa Ramirez, McKenna Petty and Katie Henderson who released their debut album, _When My Heart Felt Volcanic_, through Red Bull Records last year. Their bright and vivid sound, also characteristic of recent Paramore and The 1975, is infused with 80’s influences- shown in tracks like [“Volcanic Love”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOlVELlP2jk), [“Last One”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHt-Y4r1RFs) and [“Lovin’ Is Bible”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsy6TE8lrLQ). In 2018, they toured North America supporting COIN in the winter, X Ambassadors in the spring and 5 Seconds of Summer in the fall but are kicking off 2019 as headliners. Supporting The Aces is joan, an indie-pop duo from Little Rock, AR who most recently released their single [“drive all night”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrBXLfKDFdQ).

The Cambridge show, like many of the other _Waiting For You_ tour dates, had [sold out](https://www.ticketweb.com/event/the-aces-joan-middle-east-downstairs-tickets/8815975?REFERRAL_ID=tmfeedbuyat219208&camefrom=CFC_BUYAT_219208&impradid=219208&impradname=Bandsintown&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&wt.mc_id=aff_BUYAT_219208&utm_source=219208-Bandsintown&clickid=RIJ2W92-jXkT0przuH2uSUvrUkgSvR3uMyMWQM0&pl=mideastclub&edpPlParam=%3Fpl%3Dmideastclub) soon after they went on sale late last year- one might say that “[just like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96CwkjCDMsA) there’s nothing (tickets) left” — so if you don’t have tickets yet, you might be able to score a reasonably-priced resale.
