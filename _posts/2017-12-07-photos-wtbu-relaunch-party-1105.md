On Nov. 30, WTBU hosted a party to celebrate the reopening of their radio studio, after their previous studio suffered a fire in March of 2016. The relaunch featured performances by locals Kayce, Kyle Bent, Michael Christmas, and DJ Candy Raine in BU's Trustees Ballroom. ICYMI, here are some photos from the show by Yazi Ferrufino.
