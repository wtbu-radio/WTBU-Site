Elton John brought all of his greatest hits to life on Nov. 23 at the BB&T Center in south Florida.

John has been touring worldwide on his retirement tour, Farewell Yellow Brick Road World Tour. However, while he was “sad to say goodbye to touring,” citing a desire to spend time with his family as the reason for his farewell, the concert was not a sad occasion. The British rock legend brought the arena to life, making it feel less like a concert and more like a celebration.

At 71 years old, it is no surprise that John has decided to step off of the yellow brick road. While he did not stand up on his piano as he belted his hits as he used to, his voice rang out with the same liveliness and energy as it did years ago. Add skilled band members who have performed with him throughout his long-lasting career to the mix, and the concert went on without a single crack or missed key.

The three-hour show featured 24 songs—including an encore—with only a five-minute break for a costume change and a snack break for the audience.

There was no opening act, for someone like Elton John needs no introduction. Right on time, John and his band waltzed on to the stage making the crowd go absolutely wild. Sitting at his piano, wearing a pair of oversized bedazzled rose-tinted sunglasses, he waited until the arena went silent to play the beginning chords of his iconic song “Bennie and the Jets.”

As the show continued, he played more hits such as “Tiny Dancer,” “Rocket Man,”  “Candle in the Wind,” and “Daniel” just to list a few. After each song, the arena lights would turn on as John took the time to bow towards each side of the arena as members of the audience whooped, cheered, and blew kisses in his direction.

While he had no dancers or official back up singers to accompany him during the songs, the audience happily stepped in, chanting the lyrics word for word and swaying to the beats. It was clear that the songs being performed had an impact. Throughout the night audience, members would go from singing and dancing to crying in their seats.

One of the strongest points of the show were the visuals that accompanied each song. They all had their own themes and created unique vibes for each corresponding song, staying surprisingly modern. “The Bitch is Back,” for example, showcased a group of drag queens battling it out in front of a luxurious pool. “Candle in the Wind” showcased intimate clips of Marilyn Monroe in various photoshoots, allowing the audience to catch a glimpse of a different side to her. My personal favorite came from “Crocodile Rock,” which showcased fans from all walks of life in various Elton-related costumes.

For his song, “Believe,” John gave a genuine and heartfelt monologue detailing his work to help fight against the AIDS epidemic. As he addressed the crowd, he said, “If there's one thing I learned in my life, it's about the extraordinary healing power of love...love is truly what cures the ails of our sick world." He lamented the fact that he felt as though he did not do enough to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in its prime, which inspired him to start the Elton John AIDS Foundation. As he sang, images of appeared on secondary screens showcasing the work that he has done with the foundation over the years.

To finish off the show, he played “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” as his animated likeness walked down the brick road into the sun.  It was hard to remember that this tour did not mark the end of his musical career, but just the well-deserved retirement from his touring-career.  

Throughout the entirety of the show, John played and sang with a passion that was truly palpable. His performance brought forth the emotion and authenticity that can only be displayed through the power of live music. As he sang songs about love and triumph, it was clear that he was in his element. The Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour served to show fans that while one chapter of his career is closing, Elton John is not going anywhere just yet.
