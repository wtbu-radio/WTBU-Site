From March 8 to 17, almost half a million people flocked from around the globe to Austin, Texas, to attend South by Southwest (SXSW). It is an annual conglomerate that celebrates creative expression, bringing together film, music, interactive media, and event conferences.

Founded in 1987, it continues to grow in size and scope every year, becoming an event that captures media attention around the globe. When the festival first started, 700 visitors arrived. In 2018, approximately 432,500 people participated in the SXSW Conference & Festivals.

Musical artists play in a variety of venues around the city, ranging from churches to concert halls to outdoor barns. Many artists play multiple times throughout the festival, making their music easily accessible for SXSW-goers.

Musical talent spans across genres over the course of six days, include a variety of acts such as Cautious Clay, Amanda Palmer, J.S. Ondara, Lizzo, Car Seat Headrest, Omar Apollo, Crumb, SASAMI, Black Midi, Fontaines D.C., and Pottery. Showcasing artists from 60+ countries are represented among the official performers, hoping the festival can serve as a stepping stone for their career.

SXSW proved to be a whirlwind experience, full of talented individuals from around the world and electric scooters. The 9-day event took place from March 8-17 in the heart of the saturated city of Austin.

The event was well-organized and promoted, and it almost felt like how one would expect working at Google to be like (without an ageism lawsuit). The schedule was clearly communicated, and all events were on time.

SXSW is special because of how it nestles itself directly into the city and takes advantage of the resources and location. Concerts took place at barns in East Austin, in churches, and alongside the bustling Sixth Street. Badge holders are able to build their own schedule and attend various events based off of their own interests. They also have the ability to register for events early and bypass long lines, which was a true blessing in disguise.

I had the privilege of seeing a variety of artists. My music taste was challenged and expanded over the days spent in Austin, where I saw Black Pistol Fire, Barrie, Pink Sweat$, Cautious Clay, Logan Ledger, Willie Jones, Billy Strings, Illiterate Light, Wafia, JP Saxe, J.S. Ondara, Matt Maltese, Slow Pulp, KOKOKO!, Sidney Gish, Baneâ€™s World, SurfBort, VOILA, Odette, Sontalk, Hembree, SYML, and Donna Missal.

Barrie, a Brooklyn-based band, as well as J.S. Ondara, are musical talents to watch over the next year. They emanated a sense of confidence from the stage, and offer promising growth for the upcoming year ahead. Barrie is releasing an album next month, and Ondara is headlining his American tour in the fall.
