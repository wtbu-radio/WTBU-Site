Virtuosic Grammy-winning vocalist Bilal recently graced the stage in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum’s RISE concert series. Stage might not be the best word, no formal stage exists in the museum’s “sonic cube” Calderwood Hall. Standing in the center of the room, Bilal looked upward from behind his sunglasses to see four, square levels of almost stadium-style seats, packed with fans ecstatic to hear him perform in one of Boston’s most unique venues. He looked up and screamed, “Let’s have a party!” That’s what we did.

Before that, armed with a grand piano, synthesizer, microphone, and lone hi-hat cymbal, Bilal’s long-time sideman Jake Sherman opened with a set of cleverly introduced originals and covers, in what felt at times like a Dmitri Martin bit. Clad in bright red pants and mismatched socks, his outfit contrasted with his quiet, almost awkward demeanor and similarly mannered tunes. His background in jazz showed through in the complex harmonies and impressive runs that colored his piano playing. These provided a bluesy background for his quiet, poppy vocals, reminiscent of Phoenix’s Thomas Mars in his more thoughtful moments.

Although his lyrics and melodies were similar throughout, his arrangements kept the set interesting and showcased his skills as an accompanist as much as songwriter. He sang Joe Cocker’s “You Are So Beautiful” into a vocoder, grafting his voice over notes and harmonies he played on the synth while laying down solid funk rhythms for an unexpected and energetic performance. He followed with an original tune sung over chords on the piano and an impressive synth bass line, and a quiet harmonica version of “My Foolish Heart” (more Dmitri there). Having seen his skill at musical multitasking, I was somewhat disappointed when he rounded out the set with originals over backing tracks. Although I can appreciate having recorded the parts himself, I was left wanting to experience more of the energy that floods over you from music made in the moment. Bilal and his band were that flood.

Leaping into the center of the room rocking sunglasses, Bilal brought an energy and creativity into the room that stayed high for the whole show. Backed by an ultra-tight trio of guitar, bass, and drums, Bilal’s distinctive voice weaved perfectly into the rhythmic and harmonic gaps between the interlocking bass and guitar parts.. Bilal’s vocal ability is such that the octave shifts and falsetto shouts that are wildly difficult for most to pull off are so seamless that he makes them sound easy, especially in the context of his more soul-oriented work. However, given his eclectic sensibilities, at times Bilal and his band would shift gears completely, reworking tunes in as different styles as metal, bossa, and jazz. There was a moment when the drummer flowed perfectly out of a particularly slow, ethereal beat into a blazing swing. The bass and guitar followed right behind, and suddenly Bilal was scatting at high speed. He and his band’s ability to stay tight and build up momentum across the spectrum of popular music was insane. At one point, the drummer had built up ridiculous energy and Bilal was howling in a high register. At the peak of momentum, the band swooped into a metal-style breakdown, driving the song forward in a wildly unexpected way. They even did a grunge version of his hit “Soul Sista,” after numerous requests from the audience.

That brings me to the final, and arguably most significant part of the performance for me. For all his musicianship and drive to break new ground, Bilal was a performer above all else. He was constantly dancing, and minutes into the set, was shooting his legs in the air as he danced with a courageous audience member who came to the center of the room. Soon after, a woman who had been on the fourth level moments before was suddenly dancing there with him. His use of the intimate venue to engage with the crowd early in the show was invigorating. At least twice during the show, the audience became his backup singers without any kind of prompting from him, and you could feel him shifting his style, making room in the music for them to share the moment together without having to say anything. I expected a lot from Bilal, whose varied interests and stylistic prowess I had gleaned from only a few listens before the show. What I didn’t expect was to see a steward of connection through music, who would reciprocate his fans’ energy and admiration toward him and the music in such a meaningful way while staying true to his own goals as an artist and having a blast.
