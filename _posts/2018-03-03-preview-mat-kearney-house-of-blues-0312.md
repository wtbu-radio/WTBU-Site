Based in Nashville, singer-songwriter Mat Kearney has led a successful and exciting career thus far and has big plans for what’s next.  The future of 2018 for Kearney brings the release of his fifth studio album _CRAZYTALK_, from which the Oregon-born singer has previously released four singles, “Better Than I Used To Be,” “Face to Face,” “Don’t Cry For Me,” and “Kings and Queens.”

Kearney last released new music in 2015 with his album _Just Kids,_ making this upcoming album a much-anticipated new release. New single “Better Than I Used To Be” came as a result of Kearney’s collaboration with AFSHeeN, an electronic producer who has worked with big names including Selena Gomez and Galantis. _Bullet,_ the singer’s debut album, was released in 2004 and Kearney has since been evolving and morphing his sound and style in his four successive albums. _CRAZYTALK_ is projected to continue Kearney’s trend of genre-blending and infusing various techniques into his music.

In support of his forthcoming album, the CRAZYTALK tour is currently underway as it made its first stop in Spokane, Wash. on Feb. 19 and will run for two months ending in Dallas on April 8.  Kearney brings the tour to House of Blues Boston on March 12, 2018. Doors open at 6 p.m. and the show begins at 7 p.m. Andrew Belle and Filous are featured as main support on the tour.
