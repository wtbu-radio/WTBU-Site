<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn-based couple Matt and Kim used to tour non-stop, stopping everywhere they could across North America at festivals and headlining shows. Last year, everything changed for Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino when Schifino tore her ACL after an on-stage accident. She continued to play drums with vigor until the pain became too much to handle, and after five songs she was taken away in an ambulance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you had seen Schifino at House of Blues on Thursday night, you’d never be able to tell that any such incident occurred. She bounced on from stage right, with Johnson coming on from stage left. Wielding her sticks as she stood on her drum set, Schifino roared at the crowd and proved that she was back and better than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo started off with “It’s Alright” from their 2012 album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after a video announced “Make sure to buckle your seatbelts, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride.” Next, they played an older cut, “Block After Block,” to which Schifino jumped on her set again. She and Johnson screamed along with the crowd to the repeating line of “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” igniting the fiery energy that is known to fuel each of their shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson then announced that he wanted this show to be the best yet of tour, and then gestured to the upper balcony and said “We need to prove to our parents that people like us!” With Johnson being originally from Vermont and Schifino hailing from Providence, R.I., the Boston show was where both of their families convened. Schifino assured the crowd that she wouldn’t censor her jokes, however, and definitely maintained her usual crass humor during the show. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They continued with other classics such as “Hey Now,” “Cameras,” and “Lessons Learned.” But the pair didn’t neglect to promote their upcoming album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost Everyday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scheduled to be released on May 4. From the new album, they played some of their released singles, “Forever,” and “Like I Used to Be.” While almost all of their songs are high-energy, Matt and Kim dialed it back for “I See Ya,” where Johnson gave his spot at the keys to Schifino and sat center-stage. While the audience respected and enjoyed the gentler song, they were eager to get back to jumping and moshing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Matt and Kim show, (safe) crowd surfing is highly encouraged, especially by Schifino. Almost every song provided ample opportunity for at least one person to get off their feet and soar on top of the packed floor. Members on the balcony were able to get involved with the very interactive show by passing around a board with a GoPro camera on it. The sign wielded the phrase “Hit it in the Hot Pocket” in glittery writing, which is a statement that Schifino has made in the increasingly popular YouTube series Matt and Kim host, “Matt and Kim Show You Stuff.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair finished with their most popular song, “Daylight,” and encored with the high-energy hit, “Let’s Go.” Balloons were released from the ceiling, confetti guns went off, and inflatable sex dolls were launched into the crowd. Even with their trademark flair for the taboo and strange, Matt and Kim constantly smiled at their parents in the balcony. I can only imagine that they were filled with a mix of happiness and subtle fear, but overall pride for the talented people their children have become. The audience truly showed that Matt and Kim are loved, and Johnson announced that Boston was their favorite show of tour thus far as he and Schifino embraced. </span></p>
