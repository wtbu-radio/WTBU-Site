<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 17, WTBU DJ Monica Sucic sat down with LA’s Sure Sure before their sold-out show at the Middle East Upstairs. Coming off of a successful winter tour with Hippo Campus, vocalist and “keysman” Chris Beachy, vocalist and guitarist Charlie Glick, producer and bassist Mike Coleman, and drummer Kevin Farzad are currently on their very first headlining tour across North America. The Californian quartet talked about their unique recording studio, their first tour, and Baja Fresh.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monica Sucic: How did it feel to finally release your self-titled album this past January?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlie Glick: It felt nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Farzad: It felt good. We weren't sure if there was a market for it really. We were like "Will people care? In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">economy?" </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: "In this singles economy?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: "Do people care about an album?" The answer: I don't know. I think so. It did feel good because it did seem like people cared. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: How do you feel like your fanbase has changed since the release of the album?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: The only fanbase we really knew we had was a small fanbase in Los Angeles, since we hadn't even gone on a tour yet. Winter was our first tour, with Hippo Campus. This is our first headline tour we’re on right now, second tour ever. So we're only now getting to know our fanbase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Doing that Hippo tour helped a lot. They were playing big rooms; those guys are a hot ticket around town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: They're a hot ticket, they're a hot band. They’re hot guys, they're hot boys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Coleman: They're very attractive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Leave that in, "they're hot." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: The Hippo Campus guys are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Take that Zach Sutton over there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: They're spicy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: So a big part of the fanbase did come from the Hippo tour, but there's also older people or parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Parents of people that came to the Hippo tour. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: What's your favorite song on the self-titled album?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: I really like "Lowlife."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: I'm a "Foreign Room" boy. </span></p>
<p>Chris Beachy: I like "Giants," and I like Mike.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Hey!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: I also like "Giants" and I like "Information Machine" and "Hands Up Head Down." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: I like the whole album. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: If we didn't like any of them, we wouldn't put them on the album.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after a long pause</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] But we should've put "Caveman" on the album. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Why'd you release </b><b><i>Song from 2014</i></b><b> in 2016?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the room erupts in a mix of laughter and sarcastic anger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Look Monica, this interview is OVER. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: SECURITY!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Can you write in brackets that I'm throwing chairs right now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Technically they did come out in 2014. They didn’t get put on Spotify until 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sarcastically, in a nasally voice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] It’s a really sore subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: We grouped them together to put on Spotify. We just made a little EP and called them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Songs from 2014</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: We were not releasing stuff on Spotify for a really long time. We only put stuff on SoundCloud for a year and a half. And then one day we were like, "Hang on..."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Let me run through this quickly. "What if...we put it on Spotify?" That was the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: It was a very interesting conversation, the Spotify conversation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Can you tell us a bit about your recording studio?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: It's sick. It's home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: The control room is in Mike’s bedroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: There’s a lot of knobs and lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: There's cables running through the house. Lots of things called snakes. A bunch of microphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: It's 16 channels in one place that spits out 16 channels in another place through the cables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: It's like a bunch of tubes all over the house. Mike built these things called baffles. We can move them around. Say, "Let's do drums in Charlie's room!" and we all carry the baffles up and make a little drum fort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: And then I have to jump over the drums to get to my bed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: We leave it there for a couple of weeks and Charlie sleeps with it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: The whole house is a studio. That’s how we like to record. It allows us to record on our own schedule and allows it to be cheap. It's very consuming, because we really do record in every place in the house.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Would you prefer the house over a studio?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Studios are awesome, especially really, really nice ones that have a history. You walk into those studios and you kinda </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can kinda tell that really great records have been made there and there's some "juju," if you will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: The rooms just sound good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: You have crazy gear that no one else has because it costs hundreds of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: But it's just nice to, especially at this level, make music on our own time. As opposed to saying "We've got two weeks to make a record..."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: And for free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: We definitely would [use a professional studio], but we don't need to and we probably won't ever need to. We'll just do it eventually, because it'll be fun. It would be cool to rent a really nice house and just bring all your gear in. It's still going to be so much cheaper than renting out a really nice studio for 2 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: And it's a nice little vacation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Any acoustic space can sound good if you treat it well and know where to put the microphones. And studios can sound really sterile, too. Sometimes a room can just sound dead. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Going back to touring, what was it like touring with Hippo Campus earlier this year?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: It was insanely fun, incredibly eye-opening. We learned a lot. It was hard; it was probably the hardest thing I've ever done, but also the most fun thing I've ever done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Touring's weird, dude. Someone said this the other day, but it's "an augmented way of living."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: It's like being in a traveling circus. You go to a new place, and all the same people are in that place. But it's a different place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: It's really weird, but it's great. Couldn't have had a better first experience. They were playing such cool shows, and we just got to be a part of that. They're also very nice and kind of guided us a bit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: What's been your favorite stop on either this tour or the Hippo Campus tour?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Mine has been Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Chicago was insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: Mine's Evanston, the last show we played.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Last tour, I had a great time in Phoenix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: Phoenix was my favorite too.</span></p>
<p>KF: It was a cool new venue. It was a magical 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Will you ever go back to Baja Fresh?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: It's not that good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Baja Fresh retire. Unless they hook us up. And even then... </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: You gotta hook it up, Baja. Give us free Baja Fresh and then maybe I would go once a year. Maybe. I just feel like it's not a very healthy choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: It's just not that good–we live in Southern California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: Honestly, Taco Bell might be better than Baja Fresh. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: If you could get a tattoo for any album/song/band/etc. what would you get?</b></p>
<p>KF: None of us have tattoos so this is a fun hypothetical. What I wanted on the last tour–I felt like "this is such a crazy physical and psychological experience going on tour" that I wanted a tattoo to remember it by. Maybe I would get a tour tattoo.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: "All About that Bass." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">laughs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] Meghan Trainor, final answer. Meghan Trainor face tattoo, Mike?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MC: Yeah baby. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: Meghan Trainor knuckle tats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: I would get "I have perfect pitch" in quotes and then "Charlie Puth" on my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: I'm adjusting my answer now. I would get "Vitas."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CG: [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">starts singing "7, the Element" by Vitas, everyone joins in</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: Can you put this on your pre-show set?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All: It is! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure Sure is currently on tour. Their self-titled album and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Songs from 2014, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">featuring “The Caller,” are available on Spotify and iTunes. </span></i></p>
