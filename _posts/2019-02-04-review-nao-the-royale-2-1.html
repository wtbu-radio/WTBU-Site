<p><em>Photos &amp; review by Hannah Rogers</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British R&amp;B songbird Nao captivated a young and eager audience at a sold-out show at Boston’s Royale on Friday night. Following the release of her latest album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which came out in October, 2018, Nao is embarking on her first world tour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dressed in a fashion forward green jumpsuit and a white shawl, Nao opened the show by handing out white balloons to audience members as a symbolic gesture — her album cover for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depicts her standing in a desert with a bouquet of them. It was clear by the crowd’s excitement that Nao’s presence in the US, particularly Boston, was highly anticipated; the singer herself seemed to be thrilled by the greeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s unique singing voice proved to be just as entrancing from a stage as it is from the studio. She opened the show with her first single from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Another Lifetime”, followed by the next two singles from that album, “If You Ever” and “Make It Out Alive”. Nao carried the tunes with ease, showcasing her ethereal, high-pitched vocals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The R&amp;B singer also managed to sprinkle some tunes from her debut album of 2016, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For All We Know</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, into the setlist. Among them were singles “Fool to Love” and “Girlfriend”. Nao ended the show with “Drive and Disconnect” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and “Bad Blood”, a 2015 single from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For All We Know</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by Friday night’s performance, Nao has met a welcoming fan base in the States. She delivered an energetic, bubbly, and impressive concert experience that had her fans singing and dancing with her to every song. After a few more stops in the US, Nao will be performing in Europe through the end of March.</span></p>
