<p><em>By Olivia Malek</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s that time of year again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approach into finals season we approach another important season of the year: the season where Michael Bublé rides on the only album that’s given him substantial fame. We’re nearing Christmas, and I’m here today to talk about Spotify’s Christmas singles for this year. They have 15 singles which range in genre, song, and artist. Let’s tackle these singles from worst to best to see which artists nailed the art of covering a Christmas song.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15. “Baby It's Cold Outside” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paloma Faith</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> B.B. Bones</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People need to stop covering this song. It’s 2018. Nothing about this song is good; Paloma Faith just did not fit with this song whatsoever. This song physically upset me. Next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">14. “White Christmas” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan Trainor​</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Hallmark movie were put into song form, it would be this song. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan Trainor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has a very, very pop oriented voice, and they tried too hard to put her on a song that is very jazzy by nature. This song lost something that “Feliz Navidad” nailed: they failed to adapt the song to a pop artist. This was a big miss for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. “Last Christmas” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pale Waves</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) This song is meant to be fun. 2) They made this song sad. Pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12. “In the Bleak Midwinter” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fenne Lily</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fenne Lily</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a beautiful, hollow, folk-y voice, but overall this song was pretty unremarkable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. “Give Love On Christmas Day” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Legend</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the acoustic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Legend</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cover we all knew it was going to be. It definitely highlights his vocals and has a lovely message, but it’s unsurprising and bland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. “Little Drummer Boy” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The song definitely matches the artist; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stayed true to their roots and did a good job with this song. That being said, it didn’t feel Christmas-y to me, so I don’t think I’ll be coming back to this one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. “Christmas Must Be Tonight” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Helm &amp; The Wood Brothers</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you like folk rock you’ll love this. The artists redid the song perfectly for the genre, it just wasn’t that up my alley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon Batiste </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&amp;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Danielle Brooks</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This took another jazzy turn on a classic, which</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not so sure was successful. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batiste</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are an excellent pairing for a duet, but they could’ve done without the jazz elements of this song. If they had kept the classic music it would’ve been an excellent cover. It’s disappointing to see the duet of two talented artists go to waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. “Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Bennett </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Diana Krall​</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jackson 5</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s cover of this song will forever be my favorite rendition, but that’s not to say that this isn’t a good one too. It takes a very jazzy approach to the song, which feels very fitting with the this song’s style and makes a very nice cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. “Feliz Navidad” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Don’t We</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the cliché boy band cover you expect which isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s fun, youthful, very catchy, and even has a rap solo. That being said, I don’t know if I’ll personally be listening to this all season long, but it’s worth a shot if you’re into poppier Christmas music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. “El Burrito Sabanero” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aloe Blacc​</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacc</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goes back to his Panamanian roots for this unexpected cover. It starts traditional, and then has some Spanish side-dialogue before switching it up to be funkier, with guitar that’s almost reminiscent of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beach Boys</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is one of the more unique covers of the bunch, and one that’s unique for the better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. “Oh My Christmas Tree” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim James</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is song made me sad in the best way. Out of the acoustic covers this one nailed it. I will be back to listen to this while I’m missing setting up the Christmas tree back home and studying for finals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. “Christmas Time Is Here” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devin Dawson</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This song is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good, but that being said it wasn’t that original or unique. This is a beautiful cover and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dawson</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s voice floats over the melody so nicely and it stays true to the melancholy feel of the original, just after listening to all of the songs this one didn’t strike me as a new take. Nonetheless, it’s a fantastic cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. “Oh Holy Night” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nina Nesbitt​</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This song is the perfect modern remake of a Christmas classic. It blends </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nesbitt’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> airy indie pop voice with the more traditional piano, gospel, and harp of this song flawlessly. I cannot get over this song and will be continuing to listen to it all holiday season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Linus and Lucy (A Charlie Brown Christmas)” - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson .paak</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three F’s to describe this song: Fresh, Funky, (my) Favorite. Do yourself a favor and go listen to this yourself.  Bravo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson .paak</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
