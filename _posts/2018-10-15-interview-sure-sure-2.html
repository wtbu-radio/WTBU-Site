<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Californian indie pop four-piece Sure Sure is bopping their way across the country on their “first ever third tour” this fall. After soaring off the success of their first two tours earlier in 2018, guitarist Charlie Glick, drummer Kevin Farzad, bassist and self-proclaimed “GOAT” Michael Coleman, and “keysman” Chris Beachy have been ecstatically cooking up new tunes and preparing for tour. WTBU journalist Monica Sucic chatted with Sure Sure for the first ever second time.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monica Sucic: It’s been a while since I last spoke to you guys in April. How’ve you all been? What have you been working on during the summer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure Sure: Yoooo, what’s up Monica?! We have been writing and recording new music, improving the live show with a slew of technological advancements, and working on our physiques with the help of soundman and fitness guru "Fiat Steve."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>MS: There’s been word that you’re teasing a few new songs on this tour. Why did you choose to release “Lie Lie Lie” (a.k.a. “Lie x3”) as the first new single? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: We have a lot of new songs in the pipeline but at the time “Lie 3x” was the only one that felt remotely finished and we were on a bit of a time crunch, so we thought “Heck, let's just put this puppy out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>MS: Are you going to planning to take a different direction with these new songs? Or will they sound similar to what’s on your debut album?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Beachy: I definitely want to explore some new vibes and sounds. One of my goals is to put out a second album that I am as proud of as our first album. I don't know what it will sound like yet, but I would like to capture as many rare vibes as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>MS: Which song is your favorite to play live (new or old)? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: We have really been feeling playing some new tunes live, some of which have not even been recorded. "Idiot" and a song called "Fully Automated Lifestyle" are a blast to play and you can hear them this tour, and text us if you would like a recording of "Idiot."  Of course the old classics like "Hands Up Head Down" and the Talking Heads cover are very fun as well.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>MS: Will “The Caller” ever come back?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: Oooh, yes. Actually we have been working on that one and we will probably play it in a few cities (like Boston hehe).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>MS: You guys have 25 stops coming up on this tour. Which city are you looking forward to the most?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: Austin is super fun--we can't wait to go back. Phoenix and Salt Lake City and Chicago are always lit. Also Seattle and the Pacific Northwest in general because it's so wet up there and LA is so dry, so it's like going to an alien planet where there's green stuff somehow growing on literally every surface. New York and Boston are great as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>MS: How has your dedicated fan base, the “True Friends,” impacted your planning for this tour? Or just your lives in general?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Farzad: I just look forward to seeing what people post in the True Friend group. Everyone is cool and smart and funny. We'll be looking for people wearing the True Friend shirts on tour this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>What’s been your favorite interaction with fans so far? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KF: I can't get over some of the stuff the True Friends made for us on the last tour. The Portland, Maine true friends made us a very special card and a Sure Sure stamp!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Is there any group or artist you’d be interested in collaborating with?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: Our friend Zachary Dyke, formerly the bass player in COIN, is an excellent producer and a very spiritual human. It would be super fun to make a record with him. Collaborating with Anderson .Paak, Little Dragon, or Kevin Parker would be a dream come true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>What’s next? An album? EP? More singles? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: We will probably release another single this year and shoot for an EP or album early next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>And, last but not least: keysman? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SS: Ah yes, the title of keysman is not an easy one to attain. One must devote their soul and life energy to the study of keys and decide which order to press them in, and when. You might encounter someone who plays piano or clavinet, and upon doing so I encourage you to dig a little deeper. Ask them, "Ah, so you consider yourself a keysman?" and see how they respond...  If they say yes, hold them in the highest regard, for it is a truly noble pursuit and one of the most difficult, considering how many keys there are and how many orders there are in which to press them...</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure Sure will be playing at Brighton Music Hall on Tuesday, October 23</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
