<p><em>By Ioanna Karageorge</em></p>
<p>Dance your blues away this Sunday, February 24<sup>th</sup> to Empress Of’s electropop R&amp;B tunes at Brighton Music Hall! Empress Of is the music project of lyricist, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Lorely Rodriguez. Her second studio album, <em>Us</em>, was just released in October of this past year and is currently being toured. As a departure from her first self-produced album <em>Me</em>, <em>Us</em> was a group effort between many music collaborators including Dev Hynes of Blood Orange. Rodriguez embellishes her innovative synth-y beats with clever and direct lyricism that fluctuate between English and Spanish from her Honduran roots. On top of that, she has spent ample time in Boston being a Berklee School of Music graduate. If you’re a fan of raw and honest synth pop, be sure to get your ticket soon!</p>
<p>Empress Of’s anticipated Boston show will start at 8:00 pm at Brighton Music Hall on Sunday, February 24<sup>th</sup>.</p>
