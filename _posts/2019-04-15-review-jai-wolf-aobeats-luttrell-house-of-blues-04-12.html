<p><em>By Isabela Rocha </em></p>
<p><span>In a young, energetic atmosphere, Jai Wolf turned up the House of Blues on April 12. The show, opened by DJs AOBeats and Luttrell, was a great success, a combination of lights, color and energy that gave the audience a unique sensorial experience. </span></p>
<p><span>“Are you guys ready for a little journey?” Wolf said, taking over the stage. </span></p>
<p><span>Shifting between house-pop and electronic styles, Dj AOBeats opened the night with a remixed selection of American rap, Latino rap, and American pop songs such as “I’m Okay.” His work, in addition to some other artists’ famous works, such as Louis the Child’s “Chop it Up,” set up a dancing atmosphere at the modern-bohemian space of the House of Blues. </span></p>
<p><span>Following came DJ Luttrell, who started fearless, throwing heavy, wavy beats at the crowd. He changed the atmosphere for the hour, bringing a trippy, slower vibe, but raised the energy back up towards the end with pop-electronic hits. His last song, “Contact,” brought the audience close together in a happy, upbeat style. </span></p>
<p><span>At around 10 pm, Jai Wolf appeared. On top of an Orbit Stage, made by two intersecting circles, the artist started in a trippy, outer space vibe. An astronaut floated on the background, while pink and purple lights swung and spun at the rhythm of the music. </span></p>
<p><span>“We are getting lost and found and carried away,” described the lyrics, as the crowd and Wolf himself danced. Wolf brings a special originality to the stage by playing some of the beats live with electronic drums. </span></p>
<p><span>The DJ is able to connect people together with his music; his charismatic, energetic vibe took over the crowd. In the meantime, the rainbow lights, paper rain, smoke, and videos created a magical atmosphere. </span></p>

<p><span>“It’s just human nature,” the lyrics described, and Wolf seems to understand very well the nature of his crowd. His upbeat, energetic, electronic style made the crowd jump, clap, dance, and sing, shaking the three-story building on this last Friday night. </span></p>
<p><span>A show of lights, sounds, colors and images, Jai Wolf’s performance is a true sensorial experience. </span></p>
