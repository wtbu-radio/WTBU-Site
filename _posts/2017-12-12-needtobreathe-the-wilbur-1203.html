<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making their return to Boston this December, rock band Needtobreathe (stylized “NEEDTOBREATHE”) brought a plethora of stories and songs to The Wilbur theatre recently. On the aptly named All The Feels tour, their acoustic run of shows is currently underway following the initial “electric” leg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this show was part of the acoustic segment of the tour, the stage was set up with sultry lighting, bar stools for each band member, and even a red carpet underneath the setup to add to the cozy, homelike feel. In contrast to their electric version of the tour, this Boston show consisted only of stripped-down versions of many of their hits, even the electrically charged tunes.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These South Carolina natives have long been recognized as a Christian rock band, which only scratches the surface in expressing their capabilities. Their roots, as lead singer Bear Rinehart expanded upon on that Sunday night in Boston, lie with early upbringings around gospel music. Yet, the band proves to be digressing into much, much more. Combining this foundation of gospel with an evolving galvanic, rock sound, the band took on a set list packed with both energetic anthems and mellow piano tunes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The All The Feels tour is more than the next tour on the band’s agenda. It was crafted to exemplify the contrast between the electric capabilities of the group with their impeccable songwriting and vocal talents. Given the tour name, the show was also meant to evoke heavy emotion surrounding the band’s most personal tracks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lulls between songs, lead singer Bear would incorporate stories to make the show feel like more of a sit-down, casual gathering of friends. One story he told before the band played “No Excuses,” a hit off of their most recent album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard Love</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, expressed how the band retreated to a secluded house with friends to write the album. Telling engaging, sincere stories like these are exactly why the group’s following is a close-knit community of devoted fans. The band carries an aura of sincerity that fans latch onto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the course of the night, the group integrated two covers into the set. Covers included the classics, “House of Rising Sun” by The Animals, “Stand By Me” by Ben E. King, and “Squeeze Box” by The Who. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the stories that Bear shared were some humorous anecdotes of himself and his brother and fellow band member, Bo, growing up. He would joke of Bo’s talents as a songwriter always impressing him, and shared stories of the personal songs they have written for the band. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The band has a tradition in their shows to end each set by unplugging their instruments and performing the last few songs to an exceptionally hushed crowd. In true Needtobreathe fashion, the band ended with three soulful songs including their biggest hit, “Brother.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Needtobreathe, it stands out to every fan who attended a show on the All The Feels tour just how much genuine, unparalleled talent is packed into this band. To be able to conduct a half electric, half acoustic tour and still have their biggest anthems be received just as intensely in both forms is a mark of true talent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the songwriting in each song terrific, but the vocal talents of Bear Rinehart, his brother Bo, and guitarist Seth Bolt, are tremendous. With each tour, this band proves their capabilities beyond the classification they have adopted as a Christian rock band. Needtobreathe’s music extends far beyond this category with their rock, country, and gospel influences. The intimacy of the All The Feels tour proved the way the band and their music has been shaped and evolved to where it is now. Whether acoustic or electric, Needtobreathe puts on an incomparable show every time.</span></p>
