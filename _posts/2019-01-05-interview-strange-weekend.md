WTBU's Reed Romanko sat down with Glen Ridge, New Jersey band Strange Weekend to discuss their history, music, and goals for the band. Strange Weekend is Simon Ogilvie (vocals/guitar), Aiden O'Connor (drums), and Oliver Turiano (bass).

REED ROMANKO: So, what ​is ​Strange Weekend?  
SIMON OGILVIE: Well—  
AIDEN O’CONNOR: He’s givin’ the candid answer to you.  
SO: \[Laughs\] Well, I mean, it started as me and Oliver always kind of writing songs together since we were in eighth grade or whatever, but Aiden and Oliver both know each other from— OLIVER TURIANO: Band, like marching band and all that, so then we were kind of like, wait a minute, we can combine and do something, so then it kinda just evolved through that way, and—  
SO: And like, end of 2016—  
OT: Yeah, we formed at the end of 2016—  
AO: Do we want to talk about Tituba’s Innocence?

RR: Do it! Yeah, talk about it!  
SO: Alright, so we were in a band before called Tituba’s Innocence, with Kedar Ramanathan. I played guitar, Olly played bass... it was kind of more of a joke band.  
OT: It ​wasa​ joke band! And then half way through we were like, “Maybe this shouldn’t be a joke band.”  
SO: Kedar went to college, and we were like, “Alright, we should start making some real music now.

RR: Okay, that’s fun.  
SO: We kind of just rode off of songs Me and Oliver have already wrote, and we just...

RR: Built it up from there?  
SO: Yeah, exactly, we built it up from there.

RR: Alright, awesome! With that said, who is Strange Weekend? Tell me a little about yourselves. Who are the people behind Strange Weekend?  
SO: I’m Simon Ogilvie, I play guitar and I sing, write songs...

RR: So you’re the primary songwriter you’d say?  
SO: Well, it’s a mix... We all collaborate a little bit, but it’s mostly me and Oliver, Aiden gives a lot of good advice.  
OT: He does.  
AO: \[​Laughs​\] I’m always there for advice.

RR: Alright.  
OT: I’m Oliver Turiano, and I started off as a drummer, I still am \[laughs\], but once I was just like, “Oh sh\*t, Aiden plays drums... I guess I gotta play something else now!” And also I didn’t  
want to be a drummer and like a singer/songwriter, so I started learning guitar, and now I play guitar and bass in the band.

RR: And finally...  
AO: I’m Aidan O’Connor, and I play drums for these guys, for us, yeah... I do back up vocals, we all kinda sing.  
OT and SO: Yeah, we do. \[​Laughs​\]  
AO: Yeah, I’m a drummer. I go to film school in Chicago, I study music too.  
SO: Aidan’s been writing up a new song for us. AO: We’ve been working on a music video.

RR: Oh, exciting! Are we gonna get a little sneak peek tonight?  
OT: Oh, that would have been nice. \[​Laughs​\]  
SO: But we’re all multi-instrumentalists.  
OT: Yeah, like Aidan could write a bass part, or Simon could write a guitar part, or I could think up a cool drum part, so we can all trade around a little bit.

RR: Oh, that’s dope!  
OT: We all play everything, and we’re all terrible singers.  
SO: I mean, I’m calling myself a guitar player before anything else, and then bass is a secondary thing for me. I do really enjoy playing the bass as well.  
AO: I’d say I’m a storyteller. \[​Laughs\]​  
SO: Your main thing is drumming.  
AO: Yeah, I play drums, I’m a naturally drummer.

RR: So in that vein of dabbling in each other’s instruments, have you considering going beyond that, maybe picking up a horn, or—  
SO: Oh Jesus...  
OT: In a couple songs, or two, or actually one, I use a synth, but in a lot of the songs, we actually use like strings and other arranged instruments, so we have some random piano stuff, a lot of synth stuff...  
SO: In a new song, Aidan’s gonna be playing bass, and Olly’s gonna be up on drums.  
AO: We’re going to have a little switch around, should be pretty cool.  
SO: We’re always into playing other instruments, you know — I could have thought of something on the guitar that Olly couldn’t have, and Olly could have thought of something that I couldn’t think of. Bringing out different ideas, collaborating, you know.

RR: Of course! Very important. So, what would you say is your biggest musical inspiration?  
AO: What we’re listening to right now.  
OT: I mean, at least for me — and I’d probably say for your guys, but I can’t speak for you — whatever I’m listening to at the moment is gonna be what I write from.  
SO: Yeah, whatever we’re listening to usually informs what I’m going to be writing about.

RR: Alright, so could you give me some examples?  
SO: Bands we’re all really into, Arctic Monkeys—

RR: A classic.  
OT: It’s kinda what we grew up on...  
SO: A huge guitar influence for me is Johnny Marr from The Smiths.  
AO: My Bloody Valentine.  
SO: That’s how we got into all the pedals. I really like Ryan Jarman, guitar player for The Cribs.

OT: Recently, I know I’ve listened to a lot of ‘80s stuff, like Prefab Sprout, Aztec Camera, you know, ‘80s “sophisti-pop” if you will.  
AO: Oh, of course there’s our boy, Shinner, supporting us.  
OT: They’re a go-to.

RR: In terms of lyrics, I know you all contribute your own little bit, what inspires the words you guys say in the songs?  
SO: Well, we wrote a lot of songs when we were seventeen, eighteen living in a suburban town...A lot of experiences from that.  
AO: Past relationships and stuff, the classic—  
OT: You know, the classic teen lyrics, but we always try to make them somewhat more tongue and cheek, satiristic, you gotta love that.  
SO: But nothing too heady.  
OT: No, nothing too heady! \[​Laughs\]​  
AO: I wouldn’t call myself a lyricist, but I do enjoy writing lyrics.  
OT: We like to make lyrics that people can shout along to, like those ​fat choruses.

RR: ​Fat ​choruses!

OT: With a “ph.”

RR: So what’s the end goal with you guys, for Strange Weekend?  
OT: I mean, goal for right now, I think we really enjoy putting on local shows that a lot of our friends can come to, and especially mixing the crowds of certain groups and certain friends.

SO: We want to put on a good time for everyone, we don’t want to single anyone out.  
OT: I don’t think we’ve ever been like, “We gotta get this because we gotta get huge.”  
SO: We’re still thinking on very small level right now. Obviously, obviously, we’d love to— OT: To be indie famous!  
SO: Obviously, I’d love to dropout of college and go on tour.  
OT: Oh perfect!  
SO: Right now we’re just a bunch of dudes playing some rock and roll.  
AO: Right now we’re playing, recording songs for our friends, we’re just having a good time. OT: Building up a local following, for us and our friends!

RR: Nice, I respect it. And on that note, thanks! I wish you the best of luck in your performance tonight.  
AO, OT, and SO: Thank you!  
AO: And thank you BU!
