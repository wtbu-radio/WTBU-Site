<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Spier, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transmission Impossible (Tuesdays 12-2 am)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COM Film/TV 2020</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What music are you listening to right now? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Stupid by Aston Merrygold, it’s a bop. Also, the 50 Shades soundtrack, but I don’t want to say that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite part of WTBU?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interacting with my fellow DJs is really fun. I really like just discussing music, and on our show we talk about a lot of films so that’s really fun too.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><strong>Do you do any other extracurricular?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I write for Her Campus, I work on BUTV10 and I also do Squinch Magazine. I’m making a comic for the next issue. I don’t know what it’s going to be yet, probably something from my childhood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite movie?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely When Harry Met Sally, it’s the best.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there a movie that you’ve ever seen that you really didn’t like?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfume with Alan Rickman is terrible but it’s the funniest bad movie there ever was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What was the last show you binge-watched?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite sea creature?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuttlefish, they’re a snazzy one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s your ideal radio time slot?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ooh, 8-10 pm, probably on a Tuesday. It would be nice. I don’t have many classes on Wednesdays so it’d be nice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On a scale of 1-10, how do you feel about BU housing right now?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, probably a 5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s a class that you’re really excited to take next year?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the screenwriting ones I’m planning on taking sounds really fun</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you could be a non-COM major what would it be?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure, maybe astronomy, but I don’t think I really have the brain for that. The math side of it would probably be really hard, but I think it’s really interesting.</span></p>
