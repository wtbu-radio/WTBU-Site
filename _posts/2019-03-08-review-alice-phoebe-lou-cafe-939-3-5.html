<p><em>By Hannah Rogers</em></p>
<p><span>Alice Phoebe Lou, South African singer-songwriter based in Berlin, delivered a feminist, spiritual, and psychedelic performance Tuesday night in the Red Room at Cafe 939, Berklee’s student-run co</span><span>ff</span><span>eehouse that features live performances. Lou’s album </span><em>Paper Castles </em><span>debuted today, Friday, March 8th. </span></p>
<p><span>Lou expressed excitement that the sold-out Boston show was her first tour date ever in the US. Though admittedly jet-lagged, she seemed ready to show her American audience what her and her band can do. With the attitude of Paramore’s Hayley Williams, the rasp of Brandi Carlile, and a depth all her own, Lou came ready to enrapture. </span></p>
<p><span>Lou performed older singles “Something Holy” and the Oscar shortlist nominee “She,” as well as singles from </span><span>Paper Castles </span><span>“Skin Crawl” and “Galaxies.” “Skin Crawl” especially stuck out as a female empowerment song about wanting to have a good time out without unwarranted male attention or touching. Particularly memorable lyrics from the single are “I'm not here for your enjoyment, your amusement,” “But there's not one girl/Who deserves your aggression,” and “How about I take your patriarchy, your misogyny/And I put it in the backyard/And set fire to it”. </span></p>
<p><span>Considering the current climate around feminism, this was a very powerful performance for the women in the room especially. “Skin Crawl” was not the only feminist song of the night, and it certainly wasn’t the only way Lou expressed her </span>beliefs on the subject. Before performing “Skin Crawl,” Lou clarified that it’s not a man-hating song, but one enforcing “positive feminism that we all can benefit from.”</p>

<p><span>Meaningful lyrics aside, Lou’s songs are full of whimsical keyboard synths, funky bass lines, and beautifully haunting tribal-esque calls that may be an indicator of her home continent. Overall, it was a lovely performance to experience. Lou’s tour will continue in the US for awhile, with upcoming dates in New York City, Atlanta, and San Diego.</span></p>
