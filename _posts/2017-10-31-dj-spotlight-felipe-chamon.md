**FELIPE CHAMON**

**COM-Film/TV (18’)**

**Hobby Horsing Around (Saturdays 6-8am)**

**What is your favorite WTBU memory?**

When we read listener submissions for embarrassing stories on The Blunder Years and one story was so shocking that DJ Anjali had to lie on the floor for a few minutes because she couldn't understand why this happened to the poor soul.

**What have you gained from being in WTBU?**

A best friend. One of my DJs from last semester on The Blunder Years has become one of my best friends. I am so thankful for WTBU giving this to me. Also, I have gained lots of knowledge of how to create content for my show and how to use the studio.

**What inspired you to create your radio show?**

I really enjoyed my experiences with The Blunder Years, and wanted to continue working with WTBU. I had this idea for a show about getting to know different people, and pitched it to WTBU and they liked it.

**What is your biggest piece of BU advice to people?**

Get involved. Try new clubs and new activities. Meet people.
