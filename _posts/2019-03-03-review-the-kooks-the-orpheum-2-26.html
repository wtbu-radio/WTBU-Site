<p>A fur trimmed orange coat draped over the shoulders of an elegant, wise woman. Black and white striped sleeves under a just-purchased pastel pink band tee paired with scrunchies and beat-up Chucks. A tweed newsboy cap perched atop a balding head. All ages, all races, all types of people were gathered under the roof of the Orpheum Theatre on Tuesday the 26th, ready to take a trip through the timeless, alt-rock sound of The Kooks.</p>
<p>And the band did not disappoint.</p>
<p>As lead singer, Luke Pritchard, put it, their new album <em>Let’s Go Sunshine</em>, “does what it says on the tin” by injecting a burst of positivity into their strummy, guitar heavy discography. By creating a consistent blanket of warm tones, the band backs up the punctuating, bright vocals provided by Pritchard to create an energetic yet clean performance that sounds just as good as the in studio recordings. From the moment the band stepped out on stage, it was clear that they were at home. However, the performances provided by The Kooks are not without their own character.</p>
<p>As Pritchard strode around on stage in a breezy, loose style, the confident band played off of his energy to create a well oiled machine of charm and professionalism. They’ve done this before, and they’re not afraid to let you know that. The Kooks mix in old classics with their new album tracks to give the audience a sort of tour through their greatest hits. The band breathes new life into classics like “Sofa Song” and “Bad Habit” by keeping a rolling momentum on stage and motivating the audience to sing along and enjoy the nostalgia. Even slow moments like Pritchard’s intimate piano performances hold a palpable passion behind the picture perfect sound.</p>
<p>When playing new singles like “Pamela,” the band finds a certain, upbeat energy to add to their classic, swinging melodies. Though it is clear that the four-piece is comfortable on stage, they have not shifted into complacency just yet. They want the audience to like their new sound as much as they do. Though the new album may not be the main draw for concert goers, the band works hard to mix their time tested classics in with their newer work. This allows the audience to translate the energy and love they have for their older classics very cleanly into supporting their new effort.</p>
<p>Judging by the Tuesday night performance, it is clear that The Kooks have as much passion and skill for performance as they did when they released their first, wildly successful songs. For years they have enjoyed success in the indie circuit. But it is clear that their newest era is just as strong as ever.</p>
