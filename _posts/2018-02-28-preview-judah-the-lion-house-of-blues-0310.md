Making their return to Boston this March, Judah & The Lion (Cletus the Van Records/Caroline) are bringing their biggest headlining tour to date, the Going to Mars tour, across the country. The tour is in support of the deluxe edition release of their sophomore album _Folk Hop N Roll,_ which features hits on Alternative radio, “Suit and Jacket” and “Take It All Back.”

The Going to Mars tour took the band through the US, Canada, and Europe in the fall of 2017, hitting major cities for several sold-out stops. Named after latest single “Going to Mars,” the tour’s 2018 run began in Arkansas in late January and will carry through to mid-April to end in Georgia.

Formed by way of Nashville, the band presents a unique sound consisting of an amalgamation of genres otherwise not expected to combine. Band members drew in inspiration from folk roots, to hip-hop sounds, classic rock ‘n’ roll, and pop energy to conjure up their distinct music and identity as a band. In performing live, Judah & The Lion incorporates a combination of instruments to pair with their diverse musical talents. The product is nothing less than an energetic, engaging show for the young, loyal fan base they have built.

Supported by Colony House and Tall Heights, Judah & the Lion will take the Going to Mars tour to House of Blues Boston on March 10. Doors open at 7 p.m., and the show starts at 8 p.m. Tickets and full information can be found [here](https://www.judahandthelion.com/).
