English indie rock band Florence + the Machine turned Boston’s TD Garden into a festival of love on Friday, October 12.

Artists can only dream to have the raw talent of Florence Welch, the lead singer of Florence + the Machine; it is in her blood. Her pitch-perfect voice hits the most challenging of notes effortlessly. Meanwhile, the Machine creates orchestral sounds so grand yet so lovely, the two fuse into musical perfection.

The tour is _High As Hope_, named after the band’s fourth and most recent record. One of the most beautiful releases of the year, _High as Hope_ places Florence + the Machine on a pedestal higher than they’ve ever been before. So full of heart and soul, the album is a gift rather than a find.

_High as Hope_ earns its place as the band’s softest album, for it does not feature the heavier rock anthems so fitting to earlier records _Lungs_, _Ceremonials_, and _How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful_. Don’t be fooled: _High as Hope_ packs a punch equal to, if not stronger than the rest.

First to take the TD Garden stage was Grizzly Bear, the Brooklyn-based band and a favorite of Welch, as stated by the artist herself. The alt-rock band filled the Garden with their calming blue moods through power vocals and unique riffs. Though their energy would not match what was to come, Grizzly Bear made an excellent pair with the English headliner.

Shortly after Grizzly Bear’s departure, the lights dimmed to allow for the entrance of the Machine–nearly eight musicians with a wide variety of instrumental roles. Following would be the barefooted, angelic-figure: Florence Welch. From the moment the artist floated into room, humbly appreciative of her immediate standing ovation, the audience realized that the hours to follow would be unlike any other concert–rather, a spiritual experience.

Wearing a cream-colored dress that flowed onto the rustic wooden stage, Welch began to croon the words of “June,” the opening song of _High as Hope_. This crooning would soon explode into a colorful burst of vocals, pinning the crowd to their seats.

Next, she would sing an upbeat “Hunger,” the second track off the record, while gliding across the stage like a fairy. It was a gorgeous sight: someone so free and alive. Immediately after the song’s conclusion, Welch invited those remaining in their chairs–the vast majority–to join her on their feet. In a matter of seconds, the packed arena was standing together as one. Welch had succeeded, easy as that.

Rather than racing from song to song, trying to cover as many bases and hits as possible, the band took their time; Welch, engaging with the audience, described the writing process and backstory of many songs. One of these backstories turned into a moving speech about love, where the artist beautifully stated: “I believe in you. I believe in love. Do not give up.”

One highlight was “South London Forever,” a tribute to Welch’s drunken teenage days in the London neighborhood she grew up in. A precursor to this song, Florence asked everyone in the audience to grab hands with a stranger–a seemingly uncomfortable request to place on a crowd of thousands. The loving, willing audience linked hands while chanting the chorus: _“It doesn’t get better than this / What else could be better than this?”_

Welch speaks openly about her struggles–predominantly, alcohol addiction. The artist pokes fun at prior Florence + the Machine shows, saying they were a “messier, more drunk version of this.” Growing as a band may not have resulted in such success if Welch did not grow as an individual–a challenge referenced heavily in her music, interviews, and concerts.

Another highlight was “Dog Days are Over,” a hit that launched the band’s stardom. Halfway through the song, Florence asked another unique favor from the audience, and it’s incredible that she did. In her soft, English accent, the artist requested: “Tap \[those around you on their cell phones\] on the shoulder and tell them, ‘Excuse me, could you please put your phone away?’ We’re trying to have an experience.” Welch even recommended saying it in a British accent to “make it sound more polite.”

Once the thousands of phones in the room were all tucked away, a true energy would be unleashed. Men and women leapt higher, sang louder, and danced fearlessly, following the goddess-like role model on the stage.

Florence + the Machine played several songs from earlier albums, such as “Cosmic Love” from _Lungs_, “Only If for a Night” from _Ceremonials_, “Ship to Wreck,” “Delilah,” and “What Kind of Man” from _How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful_. During “Delilah” in its entirety, Florence ran through the crowd, sprinting and forming dance circles in the pit while still keeping perfect pitch. She would return back to the stage for “What Kind of Man,” the first act’s conclusion.

The audience, yearning for more, grew louder and louder as their short moments separated from the band continued. Finally, members of the Machine began to trickle in, comforting the briefly deprived mass. Florence, following her band, would receive yet another Standing O–even more marvelous than the first.   

The encore began with “Big God,” a powerhouse from _High as Hope_. This performance, larger than life, had Welch rolling on the stage while simultaneously belting the strongest, highest of notes. Florence + the Machine closed with “Shake it Out,” an upbeat gem and favorite among the crowd. As confetti began to rain onto the audience, all were shouting aloud with the graceful Florence and her Machine, marking an epic conclusion.  

For the semi-short setlist performed (16 songs), the song choices chosen from earlier records were obscure, excluding popular fan favorites “Never Let Me Go,” “No Light, No Light,” “Spectrum,” and “You’ve Got the Love.” Regardless, the band brought something to the Garden for everybody.

A Florence + the Machine show isn’t a concert–rather, an experience. Welch’s warm and contagious energy spread to every heart and soul in the arena, creating the festival of love.
