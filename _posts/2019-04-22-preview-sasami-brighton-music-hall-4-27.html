<p><em>By Angel Kim</em></p>
<p>SASAMI (Sasami Ashworth) will headline at Brighton Music Hall this Saturday, April 27, with support from Sen Morimoto. She is currently touring her self-titled debut album that was released on March 8. Previously, singles “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2eGnkiy26g">Callous</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T61l0Qlo-1E">Not the Time</a>” were released in 2018 and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo5SBdEbEHs">Jealousy</a>” was released in early 2019. Ashworth describes <em>SASAMI</em>’s lyrics as “a mix of a diary and a collection of letters, written but never sent, to people I've been intimately involved with in one way or another.” Even though <em>SASAMI</em> is Ashworth’s first solo album, the Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter, producer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist has been making music for years, from studying French horn classically to playing synths for rock band Cherry Glazerr from 2015 to 2018.</p>
