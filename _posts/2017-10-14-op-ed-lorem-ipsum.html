<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since the fall of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitchfork</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, music journalism has been really confusing for me. I don’t want to read about why a pop song I love is a 6.5 and some obscure German noise producer is a 10. This kind of cruel criticism isn’t inspiring good music anymore. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can’t post something without getting mocked. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fader</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only cares about rap, and indie magazines like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequence of Sound</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn Vegan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have virtually dedicated their audiences as 30-somethings. Living in Boston, I tried to read/write for local music-focused magazines, but there’s only so many times one can talk about Vundabar. I was lost, looking for a strongly curated voice to tell me what to listen to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I found <a href="https://goo.gl/4NvAq5">Lorem Ipsum</a>. As someone with a short attention span and a big love for email newsletters, I was already in the ballpark for this, and once I found out about LaCroix Boi in one letter, I was convinced. Lorem Ipsum is music/food/culture letter written by Margot Boyer-Dry, a Brooklyn-based Wesleyan graduate with a biting take on popular trends. Each thrice-weekly email takes a trend that gives rise to social movements and tracks it throughout culture, like: house plants, the word “Dotard,” or why Parquet Courts collaborated with a rapper on their latest single. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newsletter often highlights emerging artists in its issues, giving equal air time and fair coverage to local artists and megastars; recent features include DRAM, Chronixx, Sinkane, and Parquet Courts. If there’s is one thing music blogging needs these days it’s some unbiased curation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsletters are simply one option of the growing market of subscriptions vying for your attention. New methods of communication are starting everyday, but this one is worth watching. There’s a reason why most of its 100,000 subscribers are NY-based media makers who are passionate about music. We’ve all done our reading, and are now looking for a cool person to say what’s to hear next. Subscribing to <a href="https://goo.gl/4NvAq5">Lorem</a> gives you that strongly curated voice.</span></p>
