On May 10, Demo Taped and Amber Mark performed at Sonia in Cambridge. Enveloping concert-goers into a soulful embrace, the two both used the night to showcase their growth as artists with their respective 2018 EP releases.

Adam Alexander, professionally known as Demo Taped, opened for Amber Mark. He is a 19-year-old singer-songwriter who hails from Atlanta. His music is electronic pop, as he relies heavily on his Akai MPD32 soundboard.

Demo Taped’s energy, building from his bouncing, Adidas-clad feet and waving arms, quickly transferred to the audience. His smile electric, his jumpsuit cuffed at the ankles, bracelets covering his wrists and a neon sweatband covering his forehead, his radiant aura was half of his memorable performance.  

Demo Taped started with his most popular single, “Game On.” The heavy bass, flashing strobe lights, and neon colors invited listeners to dance with him. His strengths lie within his remixes, however, as seen with his rendition of Wet’s “It’s All in Vain.” Demo Taped has managed to find portions of artists’ original songs and alter it enough to have his bass-heavy, upbeat sound embedded within it. With his down and his focus directed towards his soundboard and computer, he didn’t miss a beat.

After ending his set with “Insecure”, which is the first track off his 2018 EP _Momentarily_, he spoke words of praise for Amber Mark who took the stage only moments later.

Demo Taped and Amber Mark both have similar sounds, and it made perfect sense for the two to be paired on tour together. It is rare to find artists that mesh well, and it’s a commendable effort to have found two individuals whose respect and chemistry for one another is apparent.

Demo Taped left the audience in a trance, and the spell didn’t break as Amber Mark opened her set with “Conexão,” an explosive song that was only released a few weeks ago with her EP _Conexão_. Concert-goers knew all the words, and their eyes followed her as she traversed the stage with a tambourine in one hand and a microphone in the other.

Amber Mark oozed confidence. She gave a small, half-smile as she greeted the audience at the Cambridge venue after finishing the song, leaving no time for small talk. She nodded to her band that was behind her, the lights flashed, and she seamlessly transitioned into “Lose My Cool,” a song that showcases her deep vocal range and parallels with emotional lyrics.

Amber Mark chose to wear bedazzled, light wash mom jeans. Her right leg was covered in silver gemstones, the left leg plain. This serves as the perfect analogy for her well-defined craft. Mark is an artist who can enter different realms of song (speed, lyrics, and themes) while maintaining her well-defined sound that makes her authentically _her._ With “Monsoon,” Mark recounted a heart-wrenching anecdote of a difficult breakup. She also left time to dance with upbeat tracks such as “Way Back” and “Can You Hear Me.”

Mark invited Demo Taped back on stage as the two performed their popular song “Stay,” and ended the night with “Love Me Right.” She gave one last smile and headed into the darkness off stage, her intoxicating presence lingering with the audience.
