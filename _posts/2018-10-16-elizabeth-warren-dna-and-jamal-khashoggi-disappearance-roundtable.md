The WTBU News team sits down to discuss the recent Elizabeth Warren DNA test which showed she had only a very small fraction of Native American DNA. We talk about the political implications, the state of political rhetoric today, and the position of minorities, among other things. In the second part (beginning at 31:00) we discuss the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, including the suspicious actions and statementsÂ of Saudi Arabia and President Trump's response to the situation.
