<p><em>By Julie Montana</em></p>
<p>Titans of the alt-rock scene, The Kooks are back again with their fifth studio album <em>Let's Go Sunshine. </em>The four-piece English band are no strangers to indie fans, but the rise of streaming platforms have allowed a new generation of listeners to tune into their upbeat, rhythmic sound. After enjoying more than ten years in the Spotify Top 200, The Kooks have truly cemented themselves into alt-rock history. But their newest era of hit music is just getting started.</p>
<p>The Kooks entered the music scene in 2006 with a splash hit, quadruple platinum debut album <em>Inside In/Inside Out, </em>and have been racking up acclaim ever since. Their newest album, <em>Let's Go Sunshine</em>, was released in August of 2018 and has garnered more that 36 million streams to date. Keeping with the familiarity of their early work, The Kooks have laced time tested guitar-led tracks with new, unique sounds to give their newest album a sound of its own.</p>
<p>Starting February 11th, The Kooks will be embarking on a headlining, 11 date US tour including a Boston show on February 26th at the Orpheum Theatre.</p>
