ViniloVersus is a Miami based Alernative-Rock band with music that projects garage rock energy over a fabric of pop hooks and psychedelia.  The band, originally from Caracas, Venezuela, gained international recognition from the Latin Grammy’s with back to back nominations for their 2ndand 3rdalbums.

They also garnered a reputation for their vocal opposition to human rights abuses in Venezuela.  ViniloVersus’ new album, “Days of Exile”, features the band at its peak breaking past language barriers and demonstrating a profound musical expansion.  ViniloVersus is:  Rodrigo Gonsalves, Juan Victor Belisario, Orlando Martinez and Alberto Duhau.

A few weeks ago, WTBU Music Directors Elina Kent and Olivia Truglia welcomed the band to our performance space for an in-studio session.
