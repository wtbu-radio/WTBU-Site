Monsieur Perine’s June 5th performance at the Paradise Rock Club fearlessly embodied the band’s spirit, showing true authenticity towards their sound.

The Colombian group never took itself too seriously onstage.  They were one with the crowd, and created an immediate relationship with spectators, aided by the small and personal space the venue provided.  This relationship was not one of unattainable idealization or reverence, but one of intimacy and complicity. Everyone sang the same lyrics, and danced to the same beat; exactly who was holding the microphone was not too important.

As a part of the band’s “La Sombra” world tour, the performance featured songs from all of Monsieur Perine’s discography, highlighting their latest release, “Encanto Tropical,” nominated for a Latin Grammy for best album last year.

Bursts of color, quirky tableaus, and traditional Latin American components adorned and complemented every piece beautifully, making it impossible to simply categorize Monsieur Perine as a Latin rhythm band, a psychedelic pop band, or a swing band, when they are so clearly something in between.

Roughly translating to “Romantic Swing,” their song, “Suin Romanticon,” is a clear example of these blurred lines between genres.  With clear swing elements, like the skillful saxophone and trombone, and even a reference in the title, the song surprises listeners with bongos, latin guitar rhythms, and of course, pop vocals in Spanish.  The merger of these familiar elements results in something completely unique, that is still comfortable and welcoming for listeners.

Monsieur Perine offered top tier instrumental skills in a relaxed, effortless environment.  Led by vocalist Catalina Garcia, the band is composed of six other elements. Two musicians on strings, two on brass, and two on percussion.  

The ensemble expertly came together, but Jairo Alfonso and Abstin Caviedes, who played the saxophone, clarinet, trombone and bugle, stole the show.  The two brass players are exceptional musicians, and even greater performers. Wearing matching outfits with checkered pants, the two danced in unison, and playfully interacted with the audience, all while hitting insane notes on their respective instruments.

Lead singer Catalina Garcia is a showstopper, with gracious latin dance moves and a fiery attitude.  Her energy bounced off the walls, and infected her audience with liberating ecstasy.

Throughout the concert, the musicians burst into choreographed dance.  It came as a surprise to the audience, and was even confusing at first - seeing two brass players doing synchronised kicks while playing a solo, or watching the band come together to form different shapes in tableaus.  It turned out to really work with the music, and it was these kinds of surprises that kept the audience on their toes, never knowing what to expect.

The band played hits, like “Bailar Contigo” (Dancing With You), “Sabor a Mi” (My Taste) and “Veneno” (Poison), but the most powerful performances were those where Garcia spoke to the audience, and brought everyone together in facing an issue.  

Before playing “Encanto Tropical” (Tropical Charm), a song that pays tribute to Latin America’s culture and natural vistas, she spoke about the hard times people in Colombia and other Latin American countries are facing, not only in relation to the Trump administration, but to their current governments and economic situation.  Monsieur Perine filled Latino audience members with pride and reverence, as they sang about their countries’ spirit and nature.

Near the end of the show, the band performed “Mi Libertad” (My Freedom), a song about empowerment.  Before this piece, Garcia spoke of the power of women, in creating life and sustaining it, but reminded her audience women are capable of doing more.  She referenced Latin American sexism and gender violence, and called the audience to action. Featuring traditional Latin American percussion and throat singing, “Mi Libertad” resembled a war cry, as the audience came together and sang as one.

As the band members said their goodbyes, they shook hands, played with the audience and took a group selfie, not before teaching the audience a few salsa dance moves so they could dance along to their final song.  

This cooperative atmosphere characterized Monsieur Perine’s performance.  In times of international tensions and hostility against the Latino community, it was refreshing to see an audience so diverse in age, nationality and personality come together to enjoy a night of music as eclectic as themselves.
