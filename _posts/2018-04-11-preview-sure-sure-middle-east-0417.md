Have you ever felt trapped between two different eras? Have you ever wanted to coast down that California highway of your dreams, eating up the sunshine with your hands in the air, but also felt the need to nestle yourself in the warm embrace of a dark New York City venue during the ‘80s new wave scene? Lucky for you, there’s a band for that! And that band’s name is Sure Sure. 

The four Californians are so much more than just a (self-described) “left-field pop” group. Chris Beachy takes keys and shares vocals with guitarist Charlie Glick, while Kevin Farzad handles drums and Mike Coleman controls production and bass (and occasionally a shaker or tambourine). “New Biome,” their most popular single, caught the ears of many indie pop fans on Spotify. The track is a great introduction to the band and demonstrates their powerfully charming blend of wavy chords, catchy riffs, and dance-worthy keys. When I heard the single for the first time back in 2016, it immediately stuck as something akin to Talking Heads but with a dash of something new and different. To my surprise, Sure Sure seemed to be on that same wavelength in terms of continuing a new wave kind of sound with their cover of Talking Heads’ “This Must Be The Place” that they released in 2017. They maintain the key elements of the track that make it the “Naive song” according to David Byrne, keeping the guitar and bass lines consistent, but elaborating on the keys. But Sure Sure brings their own flair to the classic, making the bass a bit more funk than punk and giving it more of a synth vibe. Also, they add a slight twist during the live performance which should not be missed. To put it simply, it won’t be possible to sit still during the second half off the song.

The quartet released their self-titled debut album in January of 2018, just before going on a cross-country tour to open for Hippo Campus. The record shows their growth from the EP, _Songs from 2014_, and demonstrates their greatest strength: variation. While every track is distinctly Sure Sure, each one is unique in its own way. “Hands Up Head Down” is like the emo cousin to more bop-appropriate songs like “Koreatown” and “Giants.” “Solstice Song” and “Information Machine” are both softer songs, perfect for some melancholy rainy-day listening. 

Sure Sure truly brings their positive vibes to the stage while performing, and I can’t wait to see them totally consume the venue with their outstanding tunes again. They encourage audience involvement for their zombie dance during “Hands Up Head Down” and there’s never a dull moment as long as they’ve got your attention. Check out their cool lyric videos on Youtube so you can prep for their show at the Middle East on April 17! Tickets are available [here](https://www.suresuremusic.com/tour).
